### Glitches
- ~~Raindropping~~ (doesn't work?)
- Cat Pause
- Lamp Glitch
- Grapple Clip on Pot
- Warp Climbing / Ladder Clip
- Fast Ladder from Trap Doors? (ask Worse)

### Ideas
- in one session, kill all of the "super" enemies
  - condor above surface grail point
  - catball at sun grail point
- getting past minibosses with lamp

### To Investigate
- does the game track hot springs trips in any way?
- how much of the game can be completed without using the grail?
