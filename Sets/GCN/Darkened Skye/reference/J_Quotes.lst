"I'm Eeb, merchant of the bizarre 
and extraordinary. I travel from

#01_15 
Eeb: "A stuffed Embliak from the 
jungles of Jampar, a live Gorple 
from the fire lands of Heem, a 
glowing lampfish from the watery 
world of Ogmire. Only the rarest of 
living things. If you've got a creature 
to sell or trade, 'show me the

Food Merchant: "We were mindin'

But I hear there's a new caravan on

Necroth'd call me Dim Sum right 
about now..." 

"I happen to live out near his neck of 
eternal chaos. I hitched a ride here 
with his minions. They're Necroth's 
special forces. They know about 
your little orange 'discovery' and 
they're here to lighten your load..." 

"He-Whose-Face-May-Not-be-Glimpsed 
and I have 'issues.'"

Draak: "Now: go to the village. Find 
the old woman named Gannish. She 
can tell you about that orange thing 
of yours that has everyone's woolies 
in a bunch."

#01_26 
Draak: "That's where I came through 
with the others. Necroth can tear 
holes in reality like a cheap tunic."

Gannish: "If you think you're taking 
this old biddy without a tussle, I got 
one word for you - 
ZANABANANDA!!!!... It can't be. I 
haven't seen one of those since... By 
the Great Rainbow - that,  my 
strange young sapling, is a SKITTLES."

"I know who you are, lass. The 
question is: do you?"

Me: "I'm Skye of Lynlora. I never 
knew my father, but my mother was 
a traveling merchant."

Gannish: "Facts, pish. Do you know 
who you really are? Sit. You have 
volumes to learn and but the turn of 
a page in which to do it. Sit, sit, sit...

"What's the matter, sapling? Viper 
plant got your tongue? A rainbow, 
that's what it is. Don't stare at me 
like I'm the back end of a dwentil. 
Rainbows were real. And when they 
appeared, so did the SKITTLES. 
Raining forth like colored hail...

"What were SKITTLES, you ask? Heh, 
heh, heh. I'm just a crazy old crone, 
what would I know? Heh, heh, heh. 
But I will tell you this: The people 
knew magic then, and 'twas SKITTLES 
what fueled that magic... 

"But then Necroth did the 
unthinkable. He forged the Dark 
Prism and channeled the rainbow to 
his own foul realm, so that all the 
SKITTLES would be his... He rounded 
up every last remaining SKITTLES 
from the people and outlawed magic 
forever. All except his own... Some 
whisper that a few SKITTLES yet 
remain. And that some day, the 
magic will return. Aye, some day, 
some day, some day...

"Look again... The Foretimes. When 
rainbows reigned and SKITTLES 
flowed and magic ruled the day. 
Mark well this land - you must 
travel there. You must find this wise 
and ancient man. He has a plan to 
restore the Rainbow; he knows of 
others who will help. But Necroth's 
forces have cut him off from the 
world, where he can do no good... 
I've held onto my own piece of the 
magic lo these years. Come!"

Dorian: "Your mother was 
Mariama... I can't explain now, but I 
am a friend. Look for me. I'll try to

moving...No time! Into the circle! 
Move out! Journey on! Godspeed! Er, 
SCRAM!"

#01_31 
Gannish: "There. I've bought us some 
time. I've sealed off Necroth's entry. 
But my spell won't hold forever. 
Now you must make magic, sapling... 
See the Truth and you will find the 
Sacred Circle. It will take you where 
you need to go. See the truth. Find 
the circle. Quickly."

Circle."

#05_20 
Me: "You knew about my mother. 
Why didn't you tell me?"

Gannish: "Tell you what? That your 
mother was a rebel warrior, not a 
merchant? That Necroth himself has 
set a price on her head? That she's 
probably dead right now because of 
her rebel actions? Would you have 
accepted your calling if you had 
known?... 

"The Sky Pirates are a rag-tag lot, 
but important friends. Most 
important."

Me: "I've met someone called Dorian. 
What can you tell me about him?"

Gannish: "Heh, heh, heh. Never mind 
that for now... This is the sky 
pirates' secret signal. If you can get 
the sound to reach them, they will 
come."

Me: "There's one tiny problem. I 
can't carry a tune in a bucket."

#05_21 
Gannish: "A glorious gem. This should 
do nicely. I'll see that it gets to the 
Zogles, the master stonecutters. It'll 
be their task to cut the gem into a 
finely-wrought prism. Perhaps you'll 
meet them later, but for now, 
another journey lies in wait... 

"The next world you will visit is 
called Zen'jai, The Land of the Five 
Birds. The Five Birds of Harmony 
were once united there in peace, but 
now they have flown asunder and 
dark times have fallen on the land. 
You must set things aright before 
the next prism can be ours... Go now 
and do not return without the 
second prism."

Sky Pirate 1: "Go that way till you 
reach a flying ship. Talk to Yancy. 
...Cap'n didn't mention me, did he? 
Nothin' about a card game turned

strictly necessary?"

#05_45 
Yancy: "Well, a friend of Bloodsquall 
is a friend of Yancy. AND you wear 
the yellow prism of Ogmire. Has 
Gannish told you of the green one?"

"You've heard the story of the five 
prisms and how long ago they were 
sent to all five lands. Only four 
prisms remain. The green prism, the 
one held in your land of Lynlora, 
was destroyed years ago by thieves. 
Insensitive louts."

Me: "Destroyed? Then how can we 
ever...?"

Yancy: "By crafting a new one. It'll 
take many a skilled hand. We have 
agreed to supply the raw material. 
Our ship has scoured the five lands, 
looking for a gemstone worthy of 
the task, and at last we think we've 
found it... Take this stone to 
Gannish."

from the Zogles. Master jewelers 
and gem-cutters. They'll give you the 
key to their secret realm, where 
the prism stone awaits. But first you 
must win their trust.

"The Zogles are an ancient people 
with a time-honored tradition of 
exchanging gifts before business 
deals.  Look over there.

"I call it the Eternal Present. It was 
given by my grandmother and by 
her grandmother before her. It will

We've been attacked by Manta-

the elixirs in all five colors. When 
you're done, find us here in this

you have them."

elixirs. ...Excellent."

Me: "The fourth Rainbow prism. It's 
hard to believe I only need one 
more."

Gannish: "Yes, but the last may 
prove the hardest yet. Dare I tell 
you, lass? It's fallen into the hands of 
Necroth himself. I hope you're ready 
for what you will face..." 

#13_63
"I have always shown you visions of 
the past. I now show you a vision of

gargoyles, great friends of the 
Rainbow, may yet fly again. The 
Rainbow may again paint the skies, 
and SKITTLES may yet fall as rain 
into the warm hands of children. But 
this is not as things are in the 
Gargoyle Realms today. No, this is 
not as things are at all..."

you, unless... Quickly: you must seek 
Merlin, the ancient mage. He has 
been isolated on the last of these 
islands by those who desire his 
silence. He will tell you all you need 
to know. Take this... Go now. The 
currents of destiny are brewing 
storm clouds of darkest portent."

"Fine, I was just leaving. But I'm not

see it again, when you least expect 
it."

Merlin: "Even to my own home 
Necroth sends his lackeys. He must 
want you very badly. Daughter of 
Mariama, how pleased and how sad I 
am to see you. Listen while I tell you 
a story... 

#02_43
"Long, long ago - long before 
Necroth's time - five magical prisms 
were crafted by the Ancients. From 
these prisms the Great Rainbow was 
born. The rulers of the Five Lands 
were wise and decided that each 
realm should keep and protect one 
prism. In this way no single ruler 
could abuse the power of the 
Rainbow. And all five kingdoms would 
need to peacefully unite in order to 
create a new one... 

"The Rainbow thrived for aeons and 
over time the five prisms were 
forgotten. But now they have 
become our only hope for restoring 
the Rainbow. 

"We call ourselves the Keepers of 
the Rainbow. Your father fought for 
our cause, before he..."

Me: "Died?"

Merlin: "Yes...died. But it was your 
mother who was our true spiritual 
leader."

Me: "My mother?! She's just a 
traveling merchant!"

Merlin: "So she told you for your 
own protection. It was your 
mother's plan to find and unite the 
five ancient Rainbow prisms within 
the talisman she carried.  ...Her plan, 
your destiny. You must gather the 
prisms from all five worlds and 
unite them once again, so that the 
rainbow may be restored... 

"Somewhere deep within this place, 
the yellow prism resides. Find it. This 
crumbling city lies beyond Tikniki 
country. Go now. And keep the 
rainbow in your heart."

real name is Orlena. I help the trees 
to grow and watch over all the 
creatures of the land..." 

"A terrible darkness is coming; I can 
feel it. But I can do nothing. You see, 
we've had peace in our land for so 
long I've grown roots and can't even 
move. I'll be forced to watch as my 
forest children are destroyed..."

I thought I'd never hear...another. I

thinking? I need to do something. I 
need to move!... I'm going wherever 
the Keepers of the Rainbow need me! 
As for you, Skye - yes, I know who 
you are - your mother had a dream. 
Don't let it wither...

She figured, if the key ever fell into 
the wrong hands, the baddies'd be so 
busy lookin' for a lock, they'd never 
see what was right under their 
noses. Good call... Your mother was 
some kind of woman - she'd probably 
even figure a way out of here."

#04_11 
Bloodsquall: "A shipload of thanks, 
lass. I think ye'll find a way home not 
far from here... My mates have a 
sky-camp near your home world of 
Lynlora. Show 'em this head as proof 
that you've seen me, then tell 'em to 
come fetch my sorry carcass. That's 
my own dear mother, so treat her 
right."

Statue: "With Necroth's demons in 
pursuit, many feathers were lost. 
She who cannot fly must rely on her 
protected nest instead."

Statue: "One through eleven will 
bring you near it, but twelve will lift 
up body and spirit."

"Do not leave this place until two of 
the five are yours. That is all I can 
say, my friend."

#06_33
The Birdkeeper: "You have found the 
two birds that make their nests in 
these gardens. Before you leave, 
restore color that is lost." 

#06_34 
The Birdkeeper: "You have found the 
two birds that make their nests in 
these gardens. The other three 
await in the lands beyond this 
bridge."

#06_35 
Me: "Dorian?! Or whatever your 
name is. Following me again?"

Dorian: "More closely than you can 
imagine."

#06_36 
Dorian: "Wait: before you leave, the 
nearest statue might have something 
to say."

#06_37 
Dorian: "You've found two of the 
colored birds. Your skills amaze 
almost as much as your beauty."

Me: "Who are you? Why are you 
following me? Why do you always 
pull a fade?"

Dorian: "I can't tell you now. But I'll 
be back. And I will explain 
everything. Including why...I've begun 
to fall in love with you. But now - 
quick! - across the bridge! No time to 
waste!"

#06_38 
The Birdkeeper: "Welcome to our 
land, good visitors. My flesh and 
bones walked these valleys long ago. 
But in spirit, I am still the keeper of 
the birds.

"The five colored birds protect our 
land from darkness. They hold a 
great and ancient magic.

"Like the other worlds, ours was 
long ago entrusted with one of the 
five rainbow prisms. A protective 
enchantment was devised: our prism 
glows with the power of the 
rainbow only when The Five Birds Of 
Harmony roost together as one.

"General Quang, an ally of Necroth, 
seized the prism. I had no choice but 
to release the birds, shutting off the 
prism's power, but also inviting 
darkness and disharmony into our 
land.

"Your task is twofold: Gather all five 
colored birds from across these 
lands, and recapture the prism from 
Quang before he delivers it to 
Necroth.

"One bird can be found in the sacred 
tree. Of the others, I know not. Take 
this. And may the Rainbow shine upon 
you."

#06_39 
Dorian: "Hey, traveler. As you can 
see, some of the locals have a pretty 
hard life... One of Necroth's favorite 
tricks: the Stoneflesh spell. You 
might want to try some conjuring of 
your own here. Not on me, though - 
I'm already under your spell."

Iceheart: "You fought with skill and 
honor. There is an ancient tradition 
among the Great Dragons. We must 
offer sacred succor to one who 
bests us in battle... 

"Another Great Dragon awaits. You 
may find him where the weapon of 
war becomes the tool of flight."

#07_06 
Statue: "With proper nourishment, 
the creature of stone becomes the 
creature of flesh and blood."

#07_07 
Statue: "Will a hardened beast eat 
living seeds? Or is it too petrified to 
try?"

#07_09 
Me: "Why doesn't it eat seeds like a 
normal bird?"

Draak: "Er - 'cause it's not a normal 
bird?"

#07_10 
Draak: "Some sort of fossilized 
plant. It's so old it's putrefied...er, 
pacified...er..."

Me: "Petrified."

Mysterious Enemy: "Told you I'd 
return. You don't look happy to see 
me. If my name were Dorian you'd 
be perky enough..." 

"I know you far better than you 
think. A lowly dwentil-herd with 
delusions of grandeur, desperate to 
believe her mother was some kind of 
hero..." 

"I'm an illusion? Ask that maggot 
Dorian what his true nature is. If 
you're not afraid of the truth. Ask 
him his true nature, COWARD!"

#07_36 
Mysterious Enemy: "Enough for now. 
But you and I are not finished. Not by 
a long rod."

#08_08 
Spoiled Princess: "Enter if you must. 
Otherwise, please go away."

#08_09 
Spoiled Princess: "You can't have the 
bird until you bring me my doll. 
Hurry and get me my doll!"

#08_10 
Spoiled Princess: "Go. You tire me."

#08_11 
Spoiled Princess: "Quickly. Go to my 
uncle's room. Get the prism."

#08_26 
Me: "Nice tweety - where'd'ya get it?"

Spoiled Princess: "You are frightfully 
bold to ask a direct question of me. 
Not that it's your business, but my 
uncle, General Quang, gave it to me. 
I value this bird more than almost 
anything in the world..." 

"There is one thing I love more, but 
my uncle has taken it from me - my 
favorite doll. It's locked in the 
treasure vault. I'd give anything to 
have my doll again."

Me: "How about it, a tweety for a 
doll? What do you say?"

Spoiled Princess: "Hmm, the treasure 
room is heavily guarded. But your 
suicidal antics might prove an 
amusing diversion."

#08_27 
Spoiled Princess: "Listen carefully. 
That spoiled princess bit was just an 
act. I had to test your mettle. You 
got the 'doll' and you're still on two 
feet - I'm impressed. Here... I'm with 
the rebels. My uncle is a dangerous 
and sadistic man. He has slain our 
ancient sentinels and captured the 
red prism. Soon he will deliver it to 
Necroth..." 

"I've unlocked his door. Try to get 
the prism, then look for the last of 
the birds."

#08_29 
The Birdkeeper: "You have done the 
near-impossible, you have brought 
The Five Birds of Harmony together. 
And now our prism may glow again 
with the power of the Rainbow... 
Good Skye, you have brought honor 
to yourself and your ancestors. Go 
forth and find the other prisms. The 
five worlds count on you."

#08_30 
Dorian: "Follow me, I can show you 
the way back home."

Me: "Oh? Why should I trust you?"

Dorian: "Because I'm roguishly 
handsome? Disarming yet sensitive? 
Because I'm your friend."

Me: "Really? I met another one of 
your friends. He said this bit of 
yours is an illusion, nothing like your 
true nature. What is your true 
nature, Dory, old boy?"

Dorian: "I...I can't answer that. Not 
now... Skye! Listen to me! You can 
trust me! Skye! You must!"

#10_02 
Me: "Hmm, I wonder if these stones 
are aligned with the stars. Could be 
some kind of ancient...calendar."

Draak: "Or slot machine. ...Big slot 
ma... Calendar is good.

#10_03 
Me: "A slot."

Draak: "Told you it was a slot 
machine."

#10_12 
Me: "Whoa. What's that?"

Draak: "Not a spring chicken is my 
guess."

Me: "What did Gwenella's spirit say? 
An ancient creature holds the key. 
With my swimming skills, we're 
golden."

Draak: "Yeah, like toast."

#10_15 
Draak: "The serpent creature would 
like to swallow you in one bite."

#10_18 
Me: "Looks like an old blacksmith 
shop."

#10_17
Draak: "Looks like crud-ola."

#10_22 
Watcher: "Set back the other great 
timepieces."

#10_23 
Watcher: "This is the key to the next 
of the great stone timepieces."

#10_26 
Watcher: "Set back the final 
timepiece. Revive Gwenella's horse."

#10_35 
Spirit of Gwenella: "I am the spirit of 
Gwenella. In the Foretimes I roamed 
these hills on my great white horse, 
guarding the Rainbow and the 
sacred prism. Now my spirit 
wanders restlessly."

Me: "How can I help you?"

Spirit of Gwenella: "Only by reviving 
my beloved horse and then me. Alas, 
the answers lie deep in the past."

Me: "Can't you give me a nudge in the 
right direction?"

Spirit of Gwenella: "It is said that an 
ancient creature holds the key... 
That is all I can tell you.  If my horse 
can be made to walk again, you must 
bring her to the place where my 
earthly remains lie. Far from here, 
in the Bonelands."

#10_36 
Watcher: "Are we in the past, 
remembering the future, or the 
future remembering the present? 
Or the... Oh! You have tampered with 
the great stellar calendar, you have 
set back time itself..." 

"I am called a Watcher. Throughout 
the Foretimes I watched over these 
lands. But then at last I was drawn 
into sleep."

Me: "Foretimes? Did you know 
Gwenella?"

Watcher: "Protector of the 
Rainbow, guardian of the sacred 
orange prism."

Me: "Prism? Great!  And I could snag 
that puppy where?"

Watcher: "Only Gwenella knows, 
but, sadly, she rides no more."

Me: "If I can revive her horse, maybe 
then she'll ride again. Can you help 
me?"

Watcher: "Complete the reversal of 
time that you have begun. The next 
time key is sealed within a puzzle 
box that only these hands can open. 
When you find the puzzle box, bring 
it forth to me."

#10_37 
Watcher: "Who is so bold as to 
awaken the... You must be she whose 
coming was foretold."

Me: "Uh-oh, I've been "foretold." 
That's never good. Kind Watcher, I 
am trying to..."

Watcher: "...awaken Gwenella's 
white horse. So it is written. All of 
the celestial calendars must be 
reversed. The final key you will need 
is in a secret setting that the sun 
reveals for but three minutes each 
24 hours. Look in this glass, seeker. 
What do you see? Do you see one 
clever enough to uncover the 
secret? What the looking glass 
reflects will determine your 
success."

#10_38 
Watcher: "You have done it, you 
have freed Gwenella's horse from 
the trap of time. Lead it to the Bone 
Lands, where Gwenella herself must 
be freed."

Me: "Has time been turned back 
everywhere?"

Watcher: "Alas, no. Beyond these 
cliffs time will be unaffected. Before 
you find Gwenella in the Bone Lands 
you will need to pass through goblin 
terrain. Stay alert. The goblins hold 
the key to Gwenella's rebirth."

#10_39 
Mysterious Enemy: "So...had a 
friendly chat with your little 
playmate Dorian?"

Me: "How do you know?"

Mysterious Enemy: "I told you, I'm 
closer to you than you imagine. Bet 
he didn't have much to say. Think 
about it. Doesn't he remind you just 
a little bit of someone else you 
know? You shouldn't have to think 
too hard."

#10_40 
Mysterious Enemy: "Oh dear, look at 
the time. Duty calls. We'll have to 
finish this later."

#11_02 
Me: "Hello, sir. What sort of place 
would this be?"

Goblin Prisoner: "Would be four-star 
tavern if me hads me way, but, as 
you can see, me don'ts. 'Hoosegow' 
ring bell?"

Me: "So you're a goblin?"

Goblin Prisoner: "Wish me was a-
gobblin' - gobble, gobble - but've had 
nary a bite since Neemsday. Any 
edibles, you? Have vital information, 
me. What say? A bit for a bite?"

#11_03 
Goblin Prisoner: "Oh, a finger 
sandwich! Guards having party. So 
what vital information you want? 
You are 'guest' of goblins of 
Stoneheath, finest cobblers of 
reality in all Five Lands. Upstairs live 
other goblins not convicted of major 
felonies."

Me: "I heard the goblins might have a 
secret for reviving someone long 
dead."

Goblin Prisoner: "Ha ha! You mean 
like a portable crystal time machine 
that reshuffles temporal flow for a 
single individual? HA HA! So funny! 
Where you hear that one? Ha, ha. 
Here, give you real information 
instead - this take you  places."

#11_04 
Goblin Prisoner: "There be no time 
machine which we be not planning to 
use as secret weapon of war. (belch) 
Good finger sandwich, though."

#11_12 
Me: "Er, we seem to be lacking 
something."

Draak: "I think it's called a power 
source. The 'going up' part's gonna 
be a little tricky."

Goblin Scientist: "Why come around, 
you? Nothing see here. Me no testing 
nothing. Me no testing nothing!"

Goblin Scientist: "Worshipful one of 
strongness. Me not so worth you 
pummel. Me know nothing, tell you 
everything."

Me: "What about a portable crystal 
time machine?"

Goblin Scientist: "Ha ha, funny you. 
Get laugh show, wear jingly hat. 
...OKAY, OKAY, me tell. No time 
machine - never, no invent, no make, 
no have, never. Not find in 
workshop, top floor."

Me: "Got it. Now I need the access 
code for the steam-lift."

Goblin Scientist: "NEVER! NO PART 
WITH! RATHER DIE! Okay, here."

#11_26 
Me: "Some kind of artificial barrier."

Draak: "It's a force field, Cap'n."

#11_36 
Goblin Inventor: "Time machine most 
best-est invention ever, but never 
complete."

Me: "Oh yeah, Poindexter? Why not?"

Goblin Inventor: "Need part no 
havsies. Large crystal, eight side. Me 
try lots lots crystal, never find 
right size shape. Me doom failure."

Me: "A big eight-sided crystal is all 
you need?"

Goblin Inventor: "Thinks maybe."

You'll never make it through there

horse. Then you'll see I'm worthy of

Grave Statue: "That blasphemy is a 
Black Vortex. Necroth has used them

Mysterious Enemy: "You're 
persistent, I'll give you that - like a 
boil that just won't pop."

#15_08 
Mysterious Enemy: "You've done it 
again. I suppose your tenacity 
shouldn't surprise me, given your 
origins."

Me: "What would you know about 
that?"

Mysterious Enemy: "Ha, ha. Dorian's 
not the only one with secrets. By the 
way, have you guessed his true 
nature yet? Well, if he won't show 
you his, I'll show you mine. But first 
you'll have to find me."

#15_09 
Me: "What happened to you?"

Gargoyle: "Necroth happened. 
Gargoyles can turn from stone to 
living creatures at will, but he cast a 
spell to trap us in stone form 
forever. You see, we were the chief 
guardians of the Rainbow. We never 
would have let him usurp the 
Rainbow as he did. Can you free the 
others as you have freed me?"

#15_13 
Me: "Uh-oh, something strange is 
happening."

Gargoyle: "The Black Vortices! 
They're condensing into a Black Hole. 
Hang on, it's a one-way ticket to 
Necroth."

#16_10  
Me: "You're Lord Necroth? You're 
nothing but a pathetic little..."

Necroth: "ENOUGH!!! ARE YOU SO 
NAIVE TO IMAGINE THAT SIZE HAS ANY 
COSMIC SIGNIFICANCE AT ALL? I HAVE 
STOOD TEN THOUSAND TIMES YOUR 
SIZE."

Mariama: "I was betrayed by 
someone I trusted. I'll explain later. 
For now, let's get me out of here. I 
wish I could tell you how. It takes 
three guards to open the cell; that's 
all I know."

#16_14 
Mariama: "Never trust a man who 
says, "Trust me." I once trusted 
someone with all my heart. He sold 
me out to Necroth. That man, Skye, 
was your father."

Mariama: "See what happens, Skye, 
when you trust a man who says, 
'trust me.'"

#16_18 
Mariama: "No! If you cast that spell 
on him, his powers will be 
enormous."

Me: "Good, then he can help us kick 
this clown's tail."

Mariama: "OR turn against us and 
lend his new powers to Necroth."

Me: "Mom, I know you have trouble 
trusting men after what happened 
to you, but, come on, Dad couldn't 
have been THAT bad."

Mariama: "Really? ...Skye, I'd like you 
to meet your father. NOW will you
