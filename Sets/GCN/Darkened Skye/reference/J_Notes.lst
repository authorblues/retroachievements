That orange thing I found has 
strange powers. (Mild 
understatement - look at what it did 
to my staff!) Brightly colored, 
rounded, polished like a gem...I 
wonder what it could be.

#01_18
Wow, I can run faster when I put my 
staff on my back! Go figure.

#01_02 
Wandering off and leaving the 
dwentils behind is an iffy career 
move. But then, I'm not exactly 
elbowing for a management position 
on the dwentil-herding team, am I? 
IT'S TIME THIS GAL HAD AN 
ADVENTURE. Words I'm rock-solid-
sure I'll never regret.

#01_03 
Great, now there's a gargoyle that 
hangs around inside my staff. (Is 
that what they mean by a "staff 
infection"? Sorry.) Actually, he's 
kinda cute - goes by the name of 
Draak. Beats traveling alone, I guess.

#01_04 
My staff kicks some serious butt 
now. Might be a tad perky for 
dwentil-herding now, though.
Hmmm, I wonder what else it
can do...

#01_05 
Wish I knew the password to the 
weird house with the weird lady 
inside (Gannish?).

#01_06 
Maybe that writing I couldn't read 
will be magically readable with the 
True Sight spell. Maybe there will be 
many such pieces of writing 
throughout this adventure. Hey, I 
said "maybe" - that makes it a hint, 
not a dead giveaway.

#01_19
Once I find that Sacred Circle, 
though, I'm pretty much committed 
to this whole "quest." So I still have 
time to change my mind. Mom, what 
would you do? Why can't you be here 
to help me with this?

#01_20
Found the Sacred Circle. I think. 
Looks pretty darned sacred, I'll say 
that much. Random thought - maybe I 
should actually USE it.

#01_07 
I'll have to remember to check the 
marketplace from time to time. 
Never know what bargains might 
turn up during a time of trans-
dimensional chaos.

#01_08 
That stone I found is vibrating 
strangely. Must be a Rumble Stone. 
I've heard that workers sometimes 
use them to clear away rocks and 
loose stonework. Uunscrupulous 
dentists use them as well.

#01_09
Found something called a Rune Mine. 
Legend has it that it should not be 
used for batting practice.

#01_10 
I'm weirdly drawn to that hollow log 
in the forest. Oh well, forget about 
it for now. It's too small inside. I 
can't fit through it - not unless I 
start chugging diet shakes really 
fast.

#01_11 
There's been a nasty rupture in the 
space-time continuum - I hate when 
that happens. Evil creatures are 
pouring in from another dimension. 
Also, I think I may have torn a 
hangnail.

#01_13 
Gannish sealed off the 
interdimensional-portal-thingamabob 
(I would have done it, but she beat 
me to it). How long will it stay 
sealed, though? Time may be a-
wastin'.

#01_14 
Hey self, figure out how to make 
magic, okay? (Oh, and would you be a 
doll and save the world while you're 
at it, hon? Thanks a bunch.)

#01_15 
I'd just LOVE to enter that pitch-
black, scary, stinking cave, but I can't 
see Jack in there. 'Course maybe 
Jack's not in there. Hee.

#01_17 
Some ammo for the catapult would 
be dandy. 

#05_01 
Hmm, no monsters around. Gannish's 
patented Evil-B-Gon 
Transdimensional Portal Adhesive 
must still be holding. But for how 
long?

#05_02 
Signal the Sky Pirates? It would help 
if I knew where they lived. Gee, 
Skye, maybe there's a subtle clue in 
their name. Do I need to signal them 
from a certain spot? 

#05_03 
I think it's a wrap here for now. 
Might I suggest the next stop on 
Skye's Destiny Tour?

#05_04 
Gannish knew about my mother. She 
knows something about Dorian, too, 
but she doesn't want to say it. 
Everyone I meet seems to have some 
kind of secret. Hey, why give ME 
information, right? I'm only the hero.

#05_06 
I wonder if the Sky pirates magically 
know which "rainbow"-colored 
pillows to jump on, or if they left a 
clue around here somewhere. 

#05_07 
So the Mom mystery deepens. 
Bloodsquall talks about her as if she 
were some kind of mythical hero. 
And I used to think she was 
SuperMom just because she could 
make dwentil stew AND throw a 
wicked blime-ball.

#05_08
All those times I had to stay with 
Uncle Zaizel, Mom was out 
adventuring, not buying and selling 
what-nots. I thought I would be 
heiress to a veritable what-not 
dynasty; instead I inherited THIS 
career. Thanks a bunch, Ma.

#09_01 
Wonder what happened with that 
chunk of green stone I gave to 
Gannish.

#09_02 
The little jewel-seller guy says he's a 
master gem-cutter. That rings a bell. 
Oops, never mind - that was just my 
digital sundial going off.

#09_03 
That limited edition "collector's 
plate" certainly makes a bold 
statement. More of a 
gastrointestinal eruption, really, 
than a statement.

#09_04 
The tuning fork in the wall would 
probably vibrate if I could resonate 
with it in the right key.

#09_05 
The 'shrooms give us health so that 
when we smash into large solid 
objects we don't die. 

#13_01 
I feel empty without Draak. He and 
Dorian must have been sucked into 
that portal-rupture thing. DANG -  in 
the same moment I lose both my best 
friend and my...what? Admit it, Skye, 
you've got a big-time crush on 
Dorian.

#13_03
Dorian. Dorian. Dorian. I wish I 
trusted him completely. I wish I 
didn't feel he was hiding something 
from me. I wish my innards didn't 
turn to dessert gelatin every time I 
looked at him. Oh yeah, and Draak 
too. I mean, I miss Draak. Not that bit 
about my innards and dessert. Aw, 
YOU know what I mean.

#13_02 
The note from Neenu is written in 
Tikniki. For all I can understand, it 
may as well be written in...Tikniki. 
Ahem, never mind. I just wish Draak 
were around to translate for me 
and to just...be my friend. He may be 
a bit whacked, but he makes me feel 
comfortable. Where are you, little 
guy?

#02_01 
Cold and Wet. These are adjectives 
that describe a healthy dog's nose. I 
am not a dog's nose. Dang, it's chilly 
here!

#02_02 
Who was that guy at the Sacred 
Circle? Claims to be a friend. Claims 
to know my mother. They say 
"beware the wyrmdrake in dwentil's 
clothing." Or something like that.

#02_03 
Merlin must be the wise dude 
Gannish told me to find. She said he 
has a plan for restoring the 
Rainbow. And that would be a good 
thing, right?

#02_04 
I found a spongite, some kind of 
mollusk-critter-veggie-gumblob-
thingoid. Looks a trifle dehydrated.

#02_05 
Jumping into that Whale-critter's 
open mouth would be suicidal. But 
hey, I'm Skye of Lynlora - my life has 
a "save game" feature.

#02_06 
I have a new SKITTLES in my magic-
making kit! 

#02_07 
Two new SKITTLES in my magic kit! 
I'll have to fool around with them 
soon.

#02_08 
There's something a little odd about 
the way that message I picked up is 
written. Wonder if it means 
anything.

#02_09 
The message I could not see without 
first using magic told me that 
sometimes I must first use magic in 
order to see messages. (i.e. "You 
cannot get inside without a ticket." 
"Where do I get a ticket?" "Inside.")

#02_10 
Handy Travel Tip 7: Next time you 
win a vacation package to a freakish, 
barren archipelago completely 
surrounded by water, TAKE A 
SWIMMING LESSON FIRST.

#02_11 
Those fish riders sure have a unique 
way of getting around in water. Boy, 
it'd be fun to exploit them for profit 
in a giant artificial pool at Sea Park. 
Whoa, where did THAT horrible 
thought come from? I MEAN boy, it'd 
be fun to try it out myself.

#02_12 
Methinks that not all spells work on 
all creatures. Me-also-thinks that 
maybe I can use spells in 
combination to beat certain baddies. 
Me-smart.

#02_13 
Hmm, what was that about Jonah 
leaving something behind? Who's 
Jonah? Where would he have left 
something?

#03_01 
Wonder where the so-called "heart 
of the forest" could be? Leanin' 
toward somewhere IN THE FOREST.

#03_02 
Does everything in this forest look 
the same or are my eyes are playing 
tricks on me?

#03_03 
Boy, Orlena sure isn't a happy 
camper. I mean, she's workin' up 
some serious inertia. Wish I could 
think of some way to cheer her up.

#03_04 
Everyone I meet in this place seems a 
tad glum. I mean, I've seen more 
upbeat attitudes behind the counter 
at the Registry of Cattle-Drawn 
Vehicles.

#03_05 
I suspect that the mood of the whole 
population would improve if "the 
heart of the forest" herself cheered 
up. (Can we say co-dependency 
issues, people?)

#03_07 
If I want to catch a magical musical 
bug I should find a proper container, 
one that'll let in a little O2. 'Cause if 
smothering magical musical bugs 
isn't bad karma, I don't know what is.

#03_08 
That bug's dishin' up some mean one-
part harmony.

#03_09 
We've got a jam session cooking in 
the seashell. Get down.

#03_10 
Grammy time for Seashell and The 
Bugs. I produced a number one hit.

#03_11 
The seashell I found is hollow like a 
box. Say now, THAT's convenient.

#03_12 
Weird fish - they just sort of hurl 
themselves out of the water. 
Ichthyian escapist fantasies? Or just 
really bad steering?

#03_13 
Maybe the fisher-dude would 
consider an alternate menu choice 
for his little wife-ette. There's got 
to be something more appetizing 
than Mudskuttle around.

#03_14 
I'm getting' nowhere with the lame 
bait I got from fisher-dude. Maybe I 
need new bait.

#03_16 
Fishing is an extreme sport. 
Extremely boring. Oh well, "If at 
first you don't succeed..." I forget 
the rest.

#03_17 
The ocean's calling to me. It's saying, 
"Accept my cold embrace and I will 
ferry you to worlds unknown." 
Either that or "Whoa, do you smell 
rotten shrimp?" I suspect the ocean 
is my way out of this little theme 
park. But being of the non-swimming 
persuasion, I need to think of 
another way across. 

#03_19 
Neenu says I should stand on the 
white rock. Okay, been there, done 
that. Maybe I should DO something 
while standing on the white rock. 
Nah, that makes far too much sense.

#03_20 
I need to catch a ride outta here.

#03_21 
So my mother was a rebel leader 
with a secret plan for re-uniting the 
Five Ancient Prisms in order to re-
forge the Great Rainbow from 
which all magic flows. Maybe that's 
why she was reluctant to open up on 
Parent Career Day.
I still remember the day she left, 
almost two years ago. She told me it 
would be her last merchant voyage, 
then we'd be together forever. But 
she also gave me this 5-part 
talisman. Part of her must have 
known she would never be back. I 
remember what she said when she 
gave me the talisman. She called it 
her "reunion piece." I thought she 
was talking about mother-daughter 
reunions, but now I see she was 
talking about ancient prisms.

And, hey, who was that scary 
mystery dude with the caffeine 
poisoning that Merlin chased away? 
What does he have against me? (Not 
his filthy mitts, I hope.)

#03_22 
Wow, these lily pads sink fast. 
Wonder if I should RUN and jump my 
way across.

#03_23 
We seem to have a good news/bad 
news situation here. Good news: 
Everyone has cheered up since 
Orlena's attitude adjustment. Bad 
news: The fabric of reality has once 
again ruptured and foul blasphemies 
are pouring in from another 
dimension. I tell ya, if it's not one 
thing, it's another.

#03_26
Wonder if using spells in combo 
might help beat some of the REALLY 
nasty things.

#03_24

"The most amazing eyes I could ever 
imagine," he says to me. As if that's 
going to make me all fluffled and 
rustered. Flustered and ruffled. 
Whatever.
One more little thing about this 
Dorian - OH MY GAWD, HE'S CUTE. 
Sorry, just had to get that out of my 
system. Don't read too much into it.

#03_25

So Orlena knew my mother too. 
Popular gal, Mom. Seems the only 
one who didn't know her very
well was me. Mom, why didn't you
tell about your real life? I
could have handled it. You didn't
have to lie. I know you were
only trying to protect me, but look 
at me now, on this ridiculous quest 
without a clue as to what I'm doing. 
If you had talked to me, maybe my 
odds of success - and survival - 
would be a wee bit higher. I miss you 
so much. I feel lost without you.

#04_01 
Is this old city sinking into the sea or 
rising out of it? As this is a question 
best answered in geological time, 
hope I'm not around long enough to 
find out.

#04_02 
Saw one of those blue hey-look-at-me 
things floating in the air. Ignore it? 
Sounds like a plan (a bad one).

#04_05
Glad I wore my pole-vaulting 
footwear. Looks like I might have to 
take some really BIG jumps around 
here. Speaking of which, a running 
jump sometimes works best.

#04_03 
The levers in this dungeon seem to 
be some kind of combination lock. 
You know, a LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT type of 
thing. No way these mental midgets 
could have memorized the combo.

#04_04

I can shoot spells while backing up. 
Just thought I'd mention that. Ahem.

#06_01 
What with the whole "Land Of The 
Five Birds" theme, that contraption 
with the five empty birdcages just 
might be significant. Think?

#06_02 
Let me get this straight: the bad 
guys have stolen the prism. In order 
to shut off the prism's power, the 
birdkeeper disbanded that hot act, 
The Five Birds of Harmony, releasing 
them from their long-term 
contract. Hmm, I'll bet Necroth 
would love to see a reunion tour. 
Hope those tweeties have some 
figured out some clever ways to 
protect themselves from him. Hope 
I'm clever enough to figure out what 
they are.

#06_03 
I'll work on finding the five birds, 
but I'd better have the prism in my 
mitts before catching the final 
tweety. Otherwise I'll ignite the 
prism's power while it's still in the 
hands of Necroth's buddies.

#06_04 
All of the birds I've seen around 
here are distinctly color-impaired. 
Am I missing something?

#06_05 
I know that bird I caught looks white, 
but it's one of the Birds of Harmony 
- I can feel it.

#06_06 
That violet/daisy crud must be a 
metaphor. 

#06_07 
The statues around here give me a 
weird vibe. I almost feel as if they 
have something to say.

#06_08 
According to the statue, Necroth has 
been trying to broker a reunion tour 
of The Five Birds of Harmony. Uh-oh.

#06_09 
Maybe I'd better hear what all the 
statues have to say.

#06_10 
That statue holding the seeds must 
be an elaborate bird feeder.

#06_11 
If I want to carry some water, 
maybe I should find something to 
carry it in. Oh, and E=MC? too.

#06_12 
Any way to make the sacred tree 
relax its grip a little?

#06_13 
The orange bird can't fly because it's 
plumage-challenged.

#06_14 
The statue with the annoying 
numerical rhyme might hold a clue.

#06_15 
Guess I've got to restore the white 
bird's true color before I can 
amscray. I take it its true color isn't 
white.

#06_16 
Who does this Dorian think he is, 
talking about my "beauty"? Man, 
you'd think he had a thing for me. 
Things are bad. Things scare me. I 
think.

#07_01 
I'd love to cross that lava, but 
"smelt" is a verb I have no interest in 
experiencing first-hand.

#07_02 
Hmm, the Great Dragon has an Ice 
Heart. Can that information help me 
beat him?

#07_03 
There's no fuse in the cannon, okay? 
No fuse. That means I should - hint, 
hint - put A FUSE in the cannon if I 
want to blast myself to Kingdom 
Come.

#07_04 
Life is a learning process. How did I 
beat Dragon Number 1? Might this 
not help me beat Dragon Number 2?

#07_06 
The dragon's name is Blackheart. 
BLACK. Heart. BLACK.

#07_07 
Scary Mystery Dude surfaces again. 
How is that he knows so much about 
me? And what is it about his eyes 
that seems so strangely familiar? I 
feel as if the answer's hovering just 
out of my mind's grasp, like a word 
you know but can't seem to 
remember...

#10_02 
What was that sound after I aligned 
the circles? That cosmic clock thingie 
must be an alarm clock, 'cause I 
think I woke something up.

#10_03 
The ancient creature in the pond - 
how can I get to it? Like I said, I can't 
swim and walking on water is not 
really an option. Or is it?

#10_04 
Look, game design dudes, this whole 
creature-in-the-pond puzzle is really 
out there. I mean, is this just some 
blatant attempt to sell game hints by 
phone at $1.99 a minute? 'Cause I 
ain't spending eight bucks just to 
navigate your deliberately 
complicated automated hint system 
menu only to find out that your gem 
of wisdom for this puzzle is 
something el lame-o like, "Try a 
magic spell or two." I mean it, guys! 
Okay, what's the ----ing 900 
number?!

#10_05 
What is the key the ancient 
creature holds? Could the spirit 
have been speaking literally? Is there 
an actual key? If so, where would the 
creature be holding it? It doesn't 
have any hands.

#10_06 
That old blacksmith shop looks a 
trifle unsteady. All it needs to take it 
down is a wee kick in the butt. Okay, 
maybe a little more than wee.

#10_07 
I had a Starving Stinkpot plant when 
I was a kid. I used to hide my diary in 
its carnivorous pod. Had to keep the 
plant in the dark, though. The least 
bit of sunlight and it would pop open.

#11_01 
Five to ten for impersonating a hero. 

#11_02 
Ow. Those strange zappy things 
floating around here are some kind 
of power charge. 

#11_03 
Looks like there's a purple SKITTLES 
in one of those weird machines. How 
do I shut off the protective field?

#11_04 
Something must be generating that 
force field around that planetary 
gizmo.  Some kind of machinery. 
That maybe I could zap. Hint, hint.

#11_05 
The rotating water trays in the 
planetary gizmo are an interesting 
shape. The water they're dipping in 
is crystal clear. Ahem.

#11_06 
Dead bio-mechanical monster 
blocking door. Too heavy for me to 
move, too dead to move on its own. 
What's a girl to do?

#12_01 
What was I thinking letting Dorian 
take Gwenella's horse? I don't know 
him. I don't trust him. I don't LIKE 
him. Really I don't. 

#12_02 
Dorian was right about one thing, 
though - I'd have trouble getting a 
horse through THIS forsaken place. 
He'd better show up as promised or 
I'm scrod.

#12_04 
Wish there was someone living here 
that I could talk to. All I've seen are 
the bones of something long dead. 
Wish I could find out what those 
piles of bones used to be, but I'd have 
to - gee, I don't know - REVERSE TIME 
to find that out.

#12_05 
What was is it Dorian said? He'd 
meet me at the circle of stones? Like 
that's really gonna happen. Did he 
mention anything about little flying 
piggies as well?

#14_01 
Draak once told me he lived near 
Necroth's "neck of eternal chaos." 
Wonder if this land is Draak's home. 
Wonder if that means Necroth's 
home is nearby. Wonder if it's too 
late to re-think that management 
position on the dwentil-herding team.

#14_07
If Draak CAME from here, maybe he 
RETURNED here too. Hey, it could 
happen.

#14_02 
These vampires keep getting up to 
play. Is there some way I can put 
them to bed for the whole night?

#14_03 
If I put garlic on an empty coffin, 
would that keep a vampire from 
going back inside it? Hello, that's 
probably not a good idea.

#14_04 
By putting garlic on a vampire's 
coffin, I believe I've permanently 
locked it inside. Cool.

#14_05 
If I enter the correct word in the 
door mechanism, methinks the door 
will open.

#14_06 
That Boss Vampire - excuse me, 
Vampyre - sure is resilient. Wonder 
where he goes when he's not 
harassing me. Wish he'd stay there.

#15_01 
Man, I feel weak in this place too. 
There must be more of those black 
vortices around.

#15_02 
Necroth has placed his seal on the 
door. Hmm, the grave statue told me 
that ol' Lord Nasty uses black 
vortices "to secure an area in his 
noxious grip." Theory: if I get rid of 
the all the black vortices, maybe the 
seal will no longer hold.

#15_03 
There's gotta be a way to get across 
those huge gaps in the stairs.

#16_01 
Okay, He-Whose-Face-May-Not-Be-
Glimpsed, you're goin' down. We're 
dukin' it out.  I'm comin' to git ya. 
This corner of eternal chaos ain't 
big enough for both of us. ...Know 
what? He's probably not home, I'll 
come back later.

#16_06
This adventure has been the 
toughest thing I've ever faced. But if 
I hadn't done it, I would never have 
met Draak. ...Or Dorian. I love them 
both. There, I SAID IT!! 

#16_07
I think I'm going to have to try lots 
of magic combos to get my butt out 
of here in one piece (or two, 
depending on how you look at butts).

#16_02 
If Dorian and my mother could use 
magic, too, I know we could waste ol' 
Tri-Cranium - or should I say, Dad 
(vomit).

#16_08
My father was one of the rebels 
long ago. My mother must have 
loved him once. But look at what 
hanging around Necroth has done to 
him. I'm going to do the Stomp on old 
Necro-face and that's a promise. I 
owe my father - or what was once 
my father - that much.

#16_03 
The Dark Prism! The device Necroth 
used to steal the Rainbow! Stray 
thought: maybe I'll wreck it.

#16_09
I'm about to duke it out with He-
Whose-Face-May-Not-Be-Glimpsed. 
And I intend to look him in the eye 
when I finish him off.

#16_10
There's so much I want to ask my 
mother about. Her travels and 
adventures. What was my father 
like before he changed? Did she love 
him? How did Necroth win him over? 
I hope there'll be lots of time for 
questions.

#16_04 
Some of the guards wear strange 
bracelets. What did my mother say 
about the guards and the cell?

#16_05 
My mother! I thought I'd never see 
her again! I'm going to get us both 
out of here alive or I'm going to die 
trying. Duh, Skye. Let me rephrase 
that.
