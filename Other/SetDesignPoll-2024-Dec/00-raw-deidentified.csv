The sets I enjoy most are challenging, sometimes quite grindy, and I am more than happy to do something long and arbitrary for the sake of doing something long and arbitrary, but if something is going to be an achievement just for the sake of it being an achievement, I would usually prefer it to just be in a subset.

An example of this done poorly is actually in one of my own sets, my Devilish (Game Gear) set. The game has time trials for all the stages except for stages 7 and 8, and I asked for people to go through those stages without losing a life. The only way to retry would be to go through the whole game again to replay those levels.

I can do that when I get my dev roll back.
This defiantly is something that is different from game to game. Like, the Mega Man 3 (NES) set can't help that retrying Doc Wood requires you to redo half of Shadow Man's stage for another crack at it, but for games that can keep the retry time low, they should.

I think sets below that, especially SNES era and below, have a lot more leeway for having oddball achievement sets and stuff.

The perfect RA set, should basically guide you through getting the game to a 100% completion. There might be some games that have bad 100 percent requirements, etc etc. I understand that frustration, but I do think that if you ""master"" a game, you should see everything that it has to offer: the good and the bad. On top of that, there should be a few achievements that are slightly easy to maybe moderately hard that are just fun little challenges, finding quirks in the game, or discovering easter eggs (especially for easter eggs). I really despise damageless runs or no hit runs. Games can be fickle sometimes. At the end, that should probably get every dev to around 50-60 achievements, which I think is ideal for the majority of games.

Obviously there are exceptions, like the GT4 set- which I think was very well-designed, apart from the ""get A-spec points"" achievements. Those achievements don't do much apart from increasing your A-Spec score, and you have to do a lot of out-of game digging to find cars that fit. But then theres the achievements for playing with a bunch of cars and having them in your collection- which I do think are good. Another exception would be like the Monster Hunter sets.

Achievements in a set that require damageless runs, speedruns, no hit runs, etc, or basically making the game significantly artifically harder than what the game itself presents: belong in subsets.

I am a player,"I play RA sets specifically for mastery, but I will stop short if I find myself not having fun with certain challenges","I feel that the best RA set involves natural progression challenges and goals to meet 100% completion, with the odd challenge that doesn't involve too much of an extra restriction or stipulation to complete. I feel like there might be a division in thought in regards to how an achievement set should be made, where having a set that's just about 100%-ing a game the way a developer would intend someone to isn't enough and must have other challenges on top of that, and ""purists"" who just want a checkbox to mark progression. In a way I can understand both sides, but it varies from genre to genre. I feel that when it comes to RPGs and other tightly-knit games, it feels too extra adding on more stuff to do when ""true 100%-ing"" something like a Final Fantasy or SMT is enough of a challenge on its own. Meanwhile, for a game like Armored Core there's more flexibility for adding on challenges while not restricting the player too much in attempting. That said, then there are the weird games where it's hard to imagine ANY kind of extra challenge beyond just playing the game. Katamari Damacy and We Love Katamari come to mind, both being very purist (barring 3 ""get big enough to roll up this item"" achievements in Damacy, meanwhile We Love Katamari is strictly tied to the full completion of the game.) My personal favorite are miscellaneous achievements for easter eggs or show casings of fun interactions with the game mechanics or hidden locations; something that isn't necessarily tied to any gameplay progression or any challenge beyond just being something cool to point out.

To name a specific example, I like the achievement in Ratchet and Clank 3 that not only incentivized going to the dev room to see the stuff not put into the game and not required at all for any normal 100% completion, but also one in an early level that involved long-jumping far out to a place not intended for the player to reach to show off an unused multiplayer battle map that was put into the single player level as set dressing. I love that extra kinda stuff that feels like a subtle nudging to secrets in a game in the same way a video would highlight them, in a sort of way. The set isn't perfect, but I definitely enjoyed my time with it more than I felt frustrated by the challenges proposed.

To also state achievements I'm not fond of, it's usually those that have too tight of a requirement to complete and are usually those that are missable. The same developer also did a set for Sly Cooper 2, and in that EVERY mission has a missable achievement for that involves a challenge that feels a lot more arbitrary, like limiting how many times you can attack, not touching the floor, completing under a specific time, and in a few cases a challenge that's barely that like not overheating the turrets and are just there to stitch on an extra achievement onto a mission. They are at least accessible to an extent without restarting the entire game, involving a hidden process of resetting the episode through a button combination and then proceeding through the episode all the way to the missed mission. That said, I lost interest when I accidentally completed and auto-saved over a mission where I didn't meet the missable achievement requirements.",https://retroachievements.org/game/11348,"Achievements for natural progression, obtaining hidden weapons, extra challenges that aren't missable thanks to the ability to replay missions, as well as showing off a ""pure"" run and one with the Human-Plus abilities active (which acts as a bonus to transfer into the next two games where said abilities are inaccessible)",Love,Love,Dislike,Like,Like,Like,Dislike,Love,Love,Like,Hate/Avoid,"No, I feel that the list is accurate.

Probably what i would consider a well designed RA set is one that's creative and somewhat challenging, the sets are supposed to show mastery over a game and achivements are kind of a reward so they SHOULD be at least a bit difficult in my opinion, but i wouldn't have any problem with some easier achivements like progression ones as an example. Now regarding the creative part of the achivements, i mean that while certain milestones like ""Complete a 100% of a game"", or ""Find all secrets on this level"" just as some examples, this are things i would probably do anyway while playing almost any game and i wouldn't think of this kind of achivements as much like something challenging or something to test my ""Skill"" and ""Mastery"" over a game which should probably be the purpose of an RA set, to showcase this knowledge, skill and MASTERY over a certain game, so that's why i like challenges like ""Complete this section without using [something in game]"" or ""Collect every [item in game] in this zone"", because it makes you learn and forces you to adapt and get better over a certain game, maybe explore more than you normally would in one game and get more knowledge over it or get better in game by just using certain aspects of it or not using them at all, which would make you a better player of a certain game or even a better player of a whole genre of videogames. This kind of achivements are way more rewarding and offer more to the player in terms of learning and experience over all.

For example, why is damageless Mother Brain an main set achievement in Metroid Zero Mission? It is needlessly difficult and frustrating when the game is not made to facilitate it.

The set should guide the player through everything worth seeing in the game - but shouldn't push the difficulty or tedium too far for the sake of tiny pieces of content (i.e. million matches in Melee). The set should also push players to improve their gameplay to a level that deserves the name of ""mastery"" by forcing them to engage with the precise details of the game mechanics and level design to accomplish all of the challenges in full, but never force them into a ""speedrunner"" level of skill that would require hundreds of hours to build and knowledge of how to break the game (except subsets or hacks designed for those purposes). 

A ""master"" of a game should come out of that game feeling as if they fully understand the game as designed and intended by the game developers, beyond the level of the game that the game developers felt the mass market audience would be willing to engage with - that's most of the point of set dev-created challenges - but still within the scope of that design. Some racing games include staff times that are very hard to beat and were intended to show players what high-skill play looks like while allowing less invested players to ignore them and play the rest of the game without penalty. That is what a good set should aim to do as well - provide support for the average player to earn a good number of achievements but also provide challenges that will naturally guide invested players to learn what skilled play feels like even if they aren't truly ""the best"" at the game just by mastering the set. A master should be able to look at a high-level glitchless speedrun and say ""yeah i could do that if i was willing to invest the time"" even if they would never bother to invest that time.

Alternatively if the game's skill ceiling just isn't very high or pushing players to high-level play would simply make the game very unfun due to the game's limited or bad design a good set will create challenges that are interesting for other reasons such as Tecmo Bowl's challenges related to the NFL season that the game is based on.

Progression and 100 percent are part of this, but also things that highlight less known aspects of a game or interesting interactions. Challenge achievements are also part of a good set, when they make the player interact with a game in way they normally wouldn't and make them explore options that game provides. That being said, I feel many developers often make the mistake of including challenges that come at odds with the core design philosophies in a game, such as making you skip out on collectibles in a collect- a-thon or making an achievement for beating a game with the minimum amount of health, forcing the player to often skip parts of a game they normally wouldn't but also including no damage achievements for all the bosses, making it seem redundant in my opinion. Essentially what I am trying to say is an achievement that changes your whole play through of an game in an unnatural and often somewhat unsatisfying way is not fun.

1) Missable achievements.

I do think there should be some harsher rules on missables. Putting a missble achievements in an 80 hour RPG 70 hours in feels pretty rough. I want to play the game, not be looking back and forth between a guide which creates a disconnect between me and the game, so anything that requires the players follow guides I think is pretty poor achievement design. 

I also don't love achievements that force you to beat bosses with a certain weapon, or damagless, something like that. Games are often designed around player choice, or a health system where you're expected to be hit in those instances, and the players health balanced to match that. Feels antithetical to the game design. On the flip, achievements for players to at least TRY different weapons, methods to shake people out of what they already know I think should be encouraged, just maybe not in a missable boss setting.

A lot of these made sense in Nes games that are 1 hours long, I don't think they're as welcome in Gamecube/PS2 games+ where the time investment is just so much more. The same rulebook doesn't work across all gens, so condieration of what gen, and how long is the game should be considered more when considering missables.

To be clear, that is just for CORE sets, I thing subsets should absolutely be a dev playground to go mad, but the core set should be respectful to the orginal game's design, and near no game designer is expecting you to no-damage run their game.

I am a player,"I play RA sets specifically for mastery, but I will stop short if I find myself not having fun with certain challenges","I consider a set to be well-designed if they follow the following rules:
1. cheevos are supposed to incentive players to complete the game with all the content the developers intended the players to play with (some examples: every story-related cheevos/100% level completion cheevos)
2. cheevos points should be relative to the difficulty of the content you're expected to complete (examples: B-3 GT1 license should be worth more points than the average license, damageless/hitless challenges should give more points than the not-challenging ones)
3. cheevos should be consistent to get: anything that's inconsistent to do should absolutely be avoided (for example: challenges/tricks that rely on 1% chance of success that can't be controlled/made more consistent, unless it's in the nature of the game, like Yu-gi-oh Forbidden Memories, since it's all about grinding cards, in which case it's an exception to the rule)
4. incredibly challenging cheevos that are extremely hard to pull should not be put on a main set, and instead should be put on subsets (examples: quite a lot actually, one that comes in mind is the final chozodia escape in metroid zero mission in hard that should be done in 1:50.00 or less, don't remember the correct details)
5. cheevos that artificially increase the length of the game by requiring multiple playthroughs in order to get, unless it's expected by the game, should be avoided (various examples: Klonoa 1's Deathless run and Crash Prototype's maskless and 100% islands runs, while games that require you to get a certain rank are fine as they're intended by the developers)
6. This is a bonus: cheevos that give you hints in a game that has little or very obscure hints can help to make the game more engaging (Myst is a good example)",https://retroachievements.org/game/16839,"Myst is incredibly creative when it comes to cheevos due to the following:
1. It expects you to play the whole game at it's fullest, by getting every ending (which can be gotten in one playthrough if you remember to save!)
2. It compensates some of the flaws of the game of giving you little or obscure instructions by helping you in the cheevos description (like reminding what sound is like on whichever cardinal direction you're supposed to guess, or making notes for you)
3. Few challenges that are well-reasonable: the speedrun one, while clunky to do, is doable; The rail labyrinth is not my favorite because of relying too much on sound (and i suffer severe deafness and thus i have to use hearing aid), but as the game expects you to do it, doing it without mistakes is actually doable;",Like,Love,Dislike,Neutral,Like,Neutral,Dislike,Love,Love,Like,Like,,"I like one achievement per stage, even when there might be a lot of stages","completion of all possible routes/endings, where applicable, 100%, as defined by the game, per-boss and/or per-stage challenges, as defined by the dev",3,Strongly Agree,Disagree,Agree,Neutral,Disagree

Ideally they should also have plenty of extra challenges that were not part of the original game to elevate an RA playthrough over just a regular old 100% run. But the amount and shape of these extra challenges can vary wildly by game (and there are some games where extra challenges don't make much sense at all, such as point and click adventures)

Lastly, a well designed set should keep an eye on how much grind and luck is required to get every achievement. Achievements where a lot of luck is required, yet no unique game content is seen (such as getting a high score in a minigame where you need to get a good pattern to even have a chance) should be avoided. If the luck or grind requirements lead to game content or Easter Eggs it's usually fine, unless excessive.",https://retroachievements.org/game/3934,"This set perfectly shows what I meant by sets being a ""tour guide"" of a game's content and Easter Eggs. It has a lot of missables, but many of them are unique scenes that you may have otherwise missed. I certainly didn't know about many of these when I played the set.

Something else that I really like is if games have a unique creative boss challenge for each boss that is more than a simple damageless. This set does that wonderfully and gives almost every boss their own unique twist (while still teaching me something new, such as that the iron boots can be used as a weapon.)

The set is laid out in a very logical way, so that even if you don't consult a guide you are unlikely to miss a missable as long as you check back to the RA game page periodically. And lastly, it's pretty challenging at points. The boss challenges are not trivial and the 3 Hearts Cave or Ordeals is a really nice capstone to the set's challenges.

Easter Egg achievements (Stop n Swap) and damageless boss achievements. There is no super unforgiving challenge like in Sonic 1 where it's required to beat the game deathless, but rather it's only the final boss damageless where I like the challenge. 

Which brings me to difficulty, I like it when there are different difficult achievements per set. For example in BK, beating Gruntilda damageless is not easy and you most likely have to try this several times. Which I like and is totally okay as long as it is an achievement which you can easily retry. Then you get rewarded 50 points which also feels rewarding. The only problem I would have with this kind of achievements if the set mostly contains of this achievements.

At the end, the points are fair in my opinion. To make a comparison it's again Sonic 1. Beating the whole game without dying rewards you 25 points. Beating the final boss of BK rewards you 50 points. The BK reward feels much much better.

Shmups, in general, are used as a steping stone for aspiring devs to cimb the leader so they can review that super mario or castlevania set and are my greatest disappointment with RA. The genre has an underlying layer of complexity that, if exposed, would add to the core gameplay (especially given how are arcane they are to the general player). Garegga is a counter exemple. Nothing in that set exposes the Garegga meta that defies the arcade logic. That game punishes you for playing well in such way that the player MUST see lives as a resource (like bombs and bullets) and ""suicide"" to control the adaptative difficulty. That ties into the scenario design and the extends. Every 1m, the player gets a new extend (which in turn can be suicided to reduce the how hard the game is) and certain aspects, like the flamingos of the second stage, give huge amounts of points in order to enable the player to engage with that meta. These situations (as well as the secret extends, for exemple, in the third stage where you MUSt leave the tank alive until the cross-road) are just not tested. There are tons of videos on youtube, some of which that have up to eight hours, that explains that meta were probably left untouched.

I am a player,"I play RA sets specifically for mastery, and will often complete challenges that I don't find fun in order to complete the set","A good set shows off all the things that the game is designed to do, and some of the more fun/interesting things you can do that the original designers didn't intend. Difficult challenges are fine, but challenges that are more long, boring, and/or tedious than difficult (like ""get your character(s) to level 99"" in an RPG) should be avoided. Similarly, a challenge that involves ignoring the intended mechanics (of a boss fight, e.g.) to get through something in a much longer, much harder, much less engaging way isn't a fun challenge to attempt, and should be done sparingly.

And, perhaps most importantly for a set of this nature, there are plenty of resources out there to help players learn how to do each of the tricks being highlighted.

Perhaps more importantly, there are some major pitfalls that this set does NOT fall into. Winning a game as all possible characters, when the characters themselves aren't meaningfully different from one another (if they play quite differently from one another, that's fine). Winning a multi-hour-long game at a low level, when the rest of the achievements in the set expect you thoroughly explore every aspect of the game (which, naturally, involves your level going up, meaning the low-level game has to be a second playthrough just for that). Requiring glitch knowledge for one achievement in a set, when the set otherwise works entirely off of intended mechanics (looking at you, Chris Houlihan Room). One set I've played was a challenge run that did not clearly specify the details of the challenge, forcing me to restart after what *should* have been the second achievement because I was not aware that I was supposed to avoid using stat-boosting items until it was too late. Another set I've specifically avoided (SMB1), as it included a ""collect all the coins"" achievement that requires not just finding every single coin, but also getting the maximum (or near-maximum) number of coins out of multi-coin blocks, in a way that cannot reasonably be expected of a human without a turbo controller, and that is not fun to attempt over and over and over again until it FINALLY works... on ALL THREE of the multi-coin blocks in that world.",Neutral,Like,Dislike,Neutral,Neutral,Like,Like,Love,Like,Neutral,Dislike,,I like stages to be grouped to reduce the number of overall achievements,"100%, as defined by the game, per-boss and/or per-stage challenges, as defined by the dev",2,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Neutral

So...
Progression mixed with 100 percent completion is obvious but not the only thing about a set.

Sets should be Accesible for MOST players BUT Intermediate should be the baseline! Advanced should be the ceiling but not ""I'm neuro divergent and this is my special interest"" advanced if you get me. 

Creative and fun dev created challenges have to be fairly balanced and interesting. These have to work WITH the game not AGAINST it and should make you even BETTER at playing the game by the end of it. It must be both challenging and rewarding. 

Some fun speedrun and damageless/deathless boss challenges are really fun and I dig them (I also actually really really like no death runs!) But a huge abundance of them on every stage especially on a game that has no saves, continues or level select is VERY offputting ESPECIALLY if they're missable. And if you only have one chance to do a speedrun or damageless after a full run, NO!

Missables should be marked or avoided if possible unless save states can be provided in the comments. I love a unique easter egg but no one wants to play through a 40 hour JRPG for a cheevo for a tiny different line of diagloue from an NPC near the end of a game I DON'T WANT MY NOSE STUCK IN A GUIDE OR IN THE COMMENTS FOR AN ENTIRE PLAYTHROUGH! IT MAKES THIS STOP BEING FUN!!!! Missables should ALL be marked as well - even if it's fucking obvious. ""oh but the page is full of ""!"""" Good thing you can turn that off then!

If it's subset material; it goes in a subset. Create a subset! The people who want that extra challenge will know how to patch a rom for a subset. User ""ROOMTEMPERATUREIQDERPYMCWHYISMYROMNOTWURKIN"" who can't even load an emulator properly will likely not want anything outside of progression so don't worry that he can't work out how to patch a rom.

It should be able to be actually mastered. If you have a set for a reasonably popular game on a popular console with little masters or there's a large gap between masteries and with a cheevo or two that has heaps of complaints for it's difficulty - it's not a badge of honour. The set is crap.

This site has EXPLODED since the gamecube launch and expectations have been slowly changing on what makes a good set. The original audience of the ELITIST SUPER HARDCORE are now outnumbered. RA is for EVERYBODY! Also while we are BLESSED with FREE ENTERTAINMENT from the devs who spend their OWN FREE TIME creating these sets for us; game design is an ACTUAL skill and unfortuantely some of the devs on here just HAVEN'T got it.

I am a player,"I play RA sets specifically for mastery, but I will stop short if I find myself not having fun with certain challenges","I recently mastered Dragon Ball Z Budokai 1, and I think it's a good example of what a good set is for me. I had a lot of trouble with the achievement of beating the Cell Games with Hercule, and so did many other people. HOWEVER, this is a feature of the game, it's literally a new option in the menu, and I think it makes sense for a set to explore this. I think it's an unbearable challenge, but I have no reason to complain because it was designed for the game.

What I don't like are sets like Castlevania Aria of Sorrow. I understand having some challenges in a set, I mastered Crash of the Titans which is basically that, but this set... Look, I think that in a game where the player has the freedom to use the weapons, armor and souls they prefer because it's their playstyle, having a set that LIMITS THE PLAYER and still makes them have to do it WITHOUT TAKING DAMAGE is, at the very least, subset level.

In other words, I think a good set focuses on making the player explore the game in its entirety, and sometimes adding certain challenges that still revolve around exploring the game, such as having challenges that make sense with the game design.

Another example I can give of when the set focuses on game design is the God of War set. The hardest achievement (currently) is to beat the game in less than 3 hours and 30 minutes. It's genuinely fun to learn how to shortcut any game (you don't need stupid glitches to do it in that time). The player improves as a player and the game is once again explored to the fullest! There used to be an achievement that was removed, which was to beat the game without upgrading on Very Hard, and I'm glad it was removed, it's an overly terrible challenge from start to finish that, to me, feels like a subset.",https://retroachievements.org/game/2936,"Finish the game, get 100%, complete some challenges that don't create subset debates, done. It's that simple.

For me, it's always been easy to notice when a set has something that completely breaks the logic of the game, creating challenges that completely destroy the experience. Some argue that ""you don't have to have fun"", well, games were made for that, and challenges are fun. There is a limit for less experienced players, that's why subsets were created, I just don't understand how devs ignore that and put weird challenges in the base set.

Finally, I understand that admins and devs are the ones who decide things in the end, but we have to think that creating achievements for old games means that we should be inspired by the official achievements of modern games. There is literally a link in ""unwelcome concepts"" that shows how to make achievements, and it's bizarre how many official sets on the site simply break this logic.

Sometimes in ""unwelcome concepts"" you can even reinterpret things, because for example, in ""Playing Poorly Without Purpose"", I know that it is referring to things like dying over and over again. However, playing an entire game without upgrading and without the game offering anything, wouldn't that also be ""Playing Poorly Without Purpose""? It is because of this kind of thing that I think many challenges on this site should be reconsidered, and this feedback is probably for that.

If there is excessive grinding entailed, it is only because the game itself has a reward for doing so or an in-game challenge that requires it. Level and boss specific achievements should be designed in a way so that any restrictions require the player to do something ingenious or skillful that likely would not be seen in a normal first-time playthrough (e.g. using the Ice Arrows to defeat Bongo Bongo); a challenge achievement should not be only be difficult for difficulty's sake, especially if it's contrary to the design philosophy of a game. For example, a no damage run in a Fire Emblem game would not be a good achievement, as whether or not the player gets hit is entirely dependent on RNG no matter how well they play, and redoing a chapter can be a time consuming endeavor. Furthermore, mutually exclusive achievements should be avoided unless the game itself offers or suggests them (e.g. a route split in a game's story), and it should be possible for a player to go back to earn the other achievement in hardcore mode (loading a backup save, level select, etc.) without being forced to replay the entire game up to that point.",https://retroachievements.org/game/21360,"While this set is for a long game and is comprised of many achievements, there is always another goal to work towards on the way to longer term goals.

The easiest achievements can be obtained by anyone with a passing knowledge of Pokémon, yet the hardest achievements require a solid grasp of high level competitive play to earn. While you can lose runs to bad luck, being willing to embrace unorthodox and impromptu strategies can often earn victory in the face of seemingly certain defeat.

In addition, thanks to the game's ability to customize your runs, an individual player can go about earning these achievements in a way that is most fun to them. If they want to just use Kanto Pokémon with high legendary spawn rates for Hard difficulty runs, their run is no less valid than someone who wants to go about it with the full National Dex.

Acts similar to if it were an official achievement set made by the developers, maybe with a few achievements the developers would not do, but nothing too difficult outside of that metric.

Challenge cheevos should be achievable by anyone that ""gets good"" at the game, not requiring even seasoned players 100s of attempts. Again, different games will need different cheevos. If the game is simply just hard by design then the challenge cheevos are going to cater to that audience's ""good"" players which would be way too difficult for a different game, for example.

I feel that most dev designed achievements you only ever do once and never again are unappealing and cause unnecessary friction. Not that there's never good ones but even that can be subjective.
There's other sets along the lines of Lost Kingdoms like the PSO+ set and Pokemon Channel that are most of the way there, but suffer from missing content like not having the Ragol Ring and other PSO+ content, or the Pokemon Channel set for the same thing, missing content.

The Custom Robo set https://retroachievements.org/game/25434 is a very close contender, it does have multiple ones that are not game developer intended, but they're all very easy to do and inoffensive on the path to 100%.
Though it's still not actually enjoyable to just re-fight the part 1 final boss with over powered parts from near the end of part 2, or just beat up an easy bot for the first person achievement. Those two do stand out a bit for going out of the way for no reason.
The part 1 boss one is also a bit unfortunate if the player decides to restart part 1 for whatever reason and wasn't aware it was an option.

This definition also excludes Easter Egg achievements even if they're unpleasant to do, which Custom Robo does have like the one for giving away the watch or doing 50 VS battles.

I am a player,"I don't pay much attention to RA, but I will occasionally look at the RA set to see if there are any challenges that I want to try","A well designed set encapsulates the game within the set. It leads players along the way with important milestones while tossing challenges in that are fun and capture the esscense of what the game is about while avoiding spoilers as much as possible (I find that last part *especially* important... in regard to that, I REALLY appreciate when an achievement waits until after a cutscene or story beat to pop... nothing worse than to have the story spoiled by looking at the popup right before it happens). I really enjoy when a set leads me to an easter egg or some other mechanic I otherwise probably wouldn't have figured out on my own.

Sidenote: In regards to spoilers with ""progression"" achievements, I would appreciate if maybe some kind of labeling was adopted, like the way missable achievements are makred with [m]. Maybe [s] for story or standard progression or spoilers or something (EDIT: I guess there is labeling on the site that I never noticed until now... and even a way to sort out missables which is REALLY nice.)... or, even better, if progression achievements were sorted to the bottom of the list? Would also be incredible if an achievment could be spoiler tagged or something, but I'm really just rambling at this point I guess :p",https://retroachievements.org/game/11277,"I haven't played enough sets to call any one a ""perfect"" set... but off the top of my head this one is pretty good. The ""progression"" achievements all have vague names and don't give away anything with the story... except with ""maybe"" the names of the bosses. Which is kind of unavoidable I suppose. It tosses in a challenge that some could find frustrating (Not Blind as a Bat), but I like having one or a few achievements like this as long as it doesn't rely TOO hard on RNG or insane kaizo skill, it gives a good feeling of accomplishment once beaten. While some could argue the ""no Parasite Energy"" boss achievements force a certain type of playstyle, I think they're fine and certainly better than a damageless achievement. The ""collectibles"" achievements are both thorough and reasonable and really feel like the most important things to get that 100% feeling without veering into the unreasonable. This was both a very enjoyable set to play and made me feel like I experienced everything there was to do to get 100% completion.

Edit: I want to make a note though, a ""perfect"" set is really hard to define. Witn something like an expansive RPG, I feel a perfect set leans more towards ""completionist/collectable"" players, so these guidelines would be more for something like that. With something like action, and *especially* retro sets, an abundance of challenges adds new life to the game. A game that could take minutes to beat now takes hours to master, though on the flipside, if a developer makes a challenge too hard/grindy/RNG-based, those can easily turn what was once a good set sour for the average user. This is why I appreciate the idea of *bonus* sets with ultra hard challenges, even if I most likely won't ever try to master any myself and kind of wish the process was a bit easier to access those sets (especially in regards to large disc-based games that take up extra space).",Like,Like,Hate/Avoid,Dislike,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Love,Like,Neutral,Dislike,,I don't have an opinion on the number of progression achievements.,"completion of all possible routes/endings, where applicable, 100%, as defined by the game",3,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree

Or, if they want to have more of their own challenges, don't make them exceedingly difficult like the Star Obliterator achievement for Super Smash Bros. Melee.

It's almost perfect. It could probably use a bit more challenge-type stuff, but that's hard to design I'd imagine for a puzzle platformer game.

I am a player,"I play RA sets specifically for mastery, but I will stop short if I find myself not having fun with certain challenges","Speaking mostly about longer RPG games, as they are what I play the most. An ideal well-designed set would:

1) Showcase all story-important stuff in the game.

2) Have challenges for boss fights that change how you think, or that prevent cheesy tactics, but that don't necessarily require you to prepare for them at a much earlier point of the game.
 
3) Be able to finish all the achievements in a single playthrough, or at most only branch late in the game for games, where you can go back to an older save, unless it's for story critical reasons. 
Being able to do all but one achievement in a single playthrough and then having to do another playthrough for the last cheevo is not fun, especially if it's for arbitrary reasons like Low Level runs, No Magic runs etc. These should be expanded in subsets, not shoehorned into the main set.

4) Have all missables marked, even if it might seem obvious that something is a missable.

5) Have the achievements in correct playing order, but if something is needed to get much earlier for a missable that can be only finished much later, make a second achievement (even if a 0 or 1 pointer) at the earlier point. This way, people are not forced to replay the game for missing a late achievement due to an early requirement.

5) Similarly to number 5, it's nice to have ""Loot all chests"" or ""Get all the bestiary entries"" (and similar) achievements split by locations or even by chapters/parts of the story. It really helps to track them for people that don't want to just follow a guide.

The only minor nitpick would be that the ""Treasure Hunter - Highland Kingdom"" cheevo could be split, as there is a part that's extremely short-term missable, but because it's sandwiched between an early game location and end-game location, it's not immediately clear that you missed it.",Love,Love,Neutral,Neutral,Like,Neutral,Dislike,Love,Like,Neutral,Hate/Avoid,"Most of the categories that I marked as neutral or lower instantly turn into ""Love"" ranking when implemented in a bonus subset.","I like one achievement per stage, even when there might be a lot of stages","completion of all possible routes/endings, where applicable, 100%, as defined by the game, per-boss and/or per-stage challenges, as defined by the dev",2,Disagree,Neutral,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree

I believe a well designed set should make it clear what is missable and what I can go back and do regardless of where I am in the play through.

I also think a well designed set should understand the game. If the set requires me to play through a game like seven times where even two times is a slog I'm going to get burnt out/bored.

- Have little to no missable achievements, particularly in longer games 
- Offer a few achievements that challenge the player to complete an objective in a unique way.

- Require grinding
- Expect the player to complete overly difficult/tedious challenges such as being near speedrunner levels of skill to achieve them (those are fine in a sub set though).

Showing off secrets is also fun.",https://retroachievements.org/game/2234,"I am biased because this is a set that I worked on most recently. But of course, I am going to try and design a set I am working on to meet what I am looking for in achievements. The most recent update to the set was a collaboration, so of course I let the other person develop what they were looking for in a set too, of which their ideals don't align exactly with my own. For what I made, I am happy with the results.
Achievements for beating the game as each character was removed for being grindy, and replaced with an acheivement with a unique challenge for each character. These require you to look at what your character's abilities are, and figure out how to solve the challenge for each, as it is unlikely you will achieve those specific achievements by just trying to beat the enemy. Those 8 character specific achievements I made I am extremely happy with, I think the challenges are unique, I had fun making them, and they were fun to earn whilst I was developing the set. I also like my achievements for playing the game on non-standard options, specifically setting an option called Crystal to 1/01 makes the enemy able to attack the player much more often, and that really requires you to know how to counter this as you can't just deprive the enemy of being able to attack like the default option does.
The rest of the achievements I would be fine without, and if it were my choice I would remove the rest as many are general progress achievements, which I dislike a lot.
I disagree with the idea of progression based achievements as content covering up to completion because I don't feel like it is always the case that playing a game should be considered achieving anything, to me that is the opposite of an achievement, it is just bloat and devalues other achievements and makes unique achievements harder to see through the much higher ratio of ""beat level x"" achievements. I have many other issues with the development process on the site, I disagree with the amount of hoops that need to be jumped through, and I feel creativity and efficiency of developing achievements has been severely bottlenecked since I first developed a set on the site in 2017, which is why I stopped being a developer. Most achievement sets released recently have been much lower quality over the past few years, as new rules and regulations as to the development process of a set have standardized everything making so many sets seem similar. I find it extremely disappointing to open up a set and only see achievements that are ""beat x level"", ""beat the game"", and maybe a ""beat x without dying"". I feel like this is a result of the requirement for achievements up to game completion, and the heavy recommendation of progression based achievements being the way to fufill this requirement. This alongside the requirement for developers to remain active, to keep working on sets every x period of time makes developers put in less effort sets just to keep their status of developer. I think that if these requirements were removed and achievement development was a lot simpler like it used to be, it would be a lot more fun to develop achievements, and it would result in better achievement sets as developers would be more passioniate on what they do develop, they would not feel like they are ticking boxes, each set would be more unique as to what a developers specific areas of interests are and as a whole that would make sets better. Of course, you might get lower effort content, but I would really much rather low effort content, a set with buggy achievements, no images, non standard points, than just another boring set of playing through the game.
Of course, I realise that my opinion goes against most achievement sets on the site, and there are plently of developers and players that are happy with the sets the way the are.
I am just stating what I am looking for. Occassionally I will see a game I am interested in, and I will play it, but I think it is a lot harder to do so now. I do also miss developing achievements, as I found it fun, but the most recent work I did on the site was a nightmare because of the issues I mentioned. Once again, it seems fine for other developers, but it really goes against what I like about developing content for games.
So whilst Tetris Battle Gaiden's achievement set is not perfect, no-where close, I still think the achievements I made for it that are not progression based are my ideal achievements.

I am a player,"I play RA sets specifically for mastery, but I will stop short if I find myself not having fun with certain challenges","A good set in my own opinion, is one that genuinely shows off the core of the game experience. I personally enjoy sets that can have a bit of challenge, but not challenge that is not within the scope of what the game actually intends for. For example, Mario Sunshine, while having challenges that are a bit out of scope of developer intentions, is a good set, because it shows what the game is capable of, while not wasting player time. Stuff that is in the bonus subset for Mario Sunshine is an example of what a base set for a game, show not include. Glitches that take a long time, or are extremely hard to pull off, are not good for base sets. I enjoy the experience of a game on RA, and if the set has a few challenges, I enjoy it, but if it has too many that just make it feel like a slog, then it becomes nothing more than a nuisance. 

Striving for balance, between showing what a game is capable of, and what actual content is within the game is hard, and I don't intend to claim to know exactly what that would constitute. But Achievements that are just annoying, don't constitute being parts of good sets. No hit challenges, should be a part of bonus subsets, unless a game actually has a standard of no hit runs, within the actual core of the game.

for instance: in Sly 2 most folks wouldn’t attempt to climb high elevations with the in-game hi-jump cheats or summon TOM from Toonami // in Pokémon Crystal most people don’t know that there’s graffiti on the roof of Celadon Mansion // Or in DOOM most folks don’t know you can jib an Imp barehanded by getting a Beserk power up.

Things like getting items, defeating bosses, unlocking gear, leveling up, discovering new areas, etc.

25%-33% should be challenge related, side missions, collectables, etc.

0%-20% should be easter eggs, unique ways of doing something, side modes.

Without knowing anything about the game or using a guide, getting 50%+ just by beating it should be achievable. I should not have to ""chase"" or ""grind"" more than 50%.

No misables as much as possible especially if it is towards the end of a game or takes extensive replaying. I don't want to put hours into repeating something just for an achievement or two.

Anything that requires avoiding doing something beforehand (ex Defeating a boss without using your bow is fine, but defeating the boss without picking up the bow before battle is not)

Finally anything score or time trial related where you have to be an expert at it. Sometimes can be fun to push you to do something faster or better when it doesn't matter otherwise, but if it requires you to be near perfect than it should be put in a subset. (ex defeat developer time trial on every single track should be a subset (ex Mario Kart DS), but a few of time trials that are handpicked and not requiring excessive amount of tries or perfection would be fine (ex Super Metroid ""Quick Escape"" would be more fun at 38s left not 40s to have room for 1 missed jump))",https://retroachievements.org/game/767,"Golden Sun is the closest ""perfect set"" that I played recently. Good amount of story based achievements and defeating bosses through natural play. There are ""collectables"" but none are required to do in the game. These are also not misable so its not a problem to go back through and get the few that were missed (like some if you don't get right away you have to get later when you come back through). Also has a few battle mode ones that can be done outside the story and give more of a reason to play that mode when I would not have normally.

ONLY TAKES 1 PLAYTHROUGH AS WELL! Very much appreciated and gave me enough of a reason to jump into the game for the first time.

The only complaint is the misables are tied to doing events before other events. While misables frustrating most times, these do provide little ""easter eggs"" as doing them this way does cause different events in the game. I can see why it was done and there are not many but as someone who has never played the game, its a turn off when misables are tied to doing something before something.

In other words, there is no need to create achievements that are not induced to be done By the game itself. 
For example, if a game has bosses, doing them without taking damage is acceptable, as it is a coherent challenge. But for example, within an RPG, placing a level limit to finish the game doesn't make sense Some, because an RPG was not made to be finished with a level limit. This harms the gameplay.
