</details>

### General Tips

- Press X to interact with everything.
- Reference your MAP (from the pause menu) often. This will help you immensely.
- Write everything down and you may not need to check too many hints.

<!--
<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ I see a floating piece of paper. How do I interact with it?</strong></em></summary>
Have you tried pressing every button?
<details>
<summary>
Yes I did.
</summary>
No you didn't. Press X. (You can interact with more things than you might expect, so try it on as many objects as you can.)
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ Is there any way to get a better sense of where I am and where I've been?</strong></em></summary>
Check your pause menu. In most areas, there is a MAP option you can choose that will show you your current position.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ This game is so dense. How can I keep track of everything?</strong></em></summary>
Do you own a notebook and a pencil? Get ready to write a lot of stuff down.
</details>

### Origin

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ There are some strange shapes at the front door. What are they?</strong></em></summary>
Those are the Glyphs of Origin. The building blocks of the realm.
<details>
<summary><em>What do the glyphs mean?</em></summary>
They can be translated once you learn a bit more.
<details>
<summary><em>I learned about how to translate them, can you just tell me what their meanings are?</em></summary>
No, actually. These are randomized per-file, and so you will have to learn to translate them yourself (and they will be important to note down for the future).
</details>
</details>
</details>

### Treetops

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ I found a treehouse with a noteblock inside. What do these do?</strong></em></summary>
They don't do much of anything on their own. But if you hit them, they make a funny little noise.
<details>
<summary><em>One of the noteblocks is broken. How am I supposed to figure out what noise it made?</em></summary>
Process of deduction, mostly.
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ One of these screens is slightly different than the others. What's going on there?</strong></em></summary>
There is a screen with some slightly grey trees. That might matter later.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ There is a small passageway in the top left of the map. How do I get to it?</strong></em></summary>
Jump.
<details>
<summary><em>I can't seem to get up there no matter how high I jump.</em></summary>
You might need to come back with a new different tool.
<details>
<summary><em>What tool do I need?</em></summary>
Bring the springboard from Caldera.
</details>
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ I found a dark forest glade with some torches and noteblocks. What do I do here?</strong></em></summary>
You need to hit the music box, listen to the sequence of sound effects, and hit the correct blocks. Where have you heard these sound effects before?
<details>
<summary><em>What about the sound effect I haven't heard before?</em></summary>
How many sounds did you note down? Wasn't one missing?
<details>
<summary><em>I wrote down five sounds.</em></summary>
The one you didn't note down corresponds to the broken noteblock.
</details>
</details>
<details>
<summary><em>The sounds are too fast, I can't figure out the pattern fast enough!</em></summary>
You can pause during the sequence to take all the time you need to figure out the correct block for each sound.
</details>
</details>

### Lake

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ I found a room with four animals and some coin blocks. What's happening there?</strong></em></summary>
Have you experimented with coin blocks and noticed anything interesting?
<details>
<summary><em>They never run out. What does that mean?</em></summary>
Well, you don't need coins, so they must be counting something. You need to hit each one a certain number of times before pressing the switch.
<details>
<summary><em>What number corresponds to each block?</em></summary>
That is based on the animal next to it. Have you seen those animals anywhere else?
<details>
<summary><em>Where can I find those animals?</em></summary>
The shapes of those animals can be found cut out of the walls on different screens in Lake. Is there any other information associated with those animals on those other screens?
<details>
<summary><em>Just a glyph.</em></summary>
Once you learn to translate those glyphs, you'll have the number corresponding to each animal.
</details>
</details>
</details>
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ I solved the animal puzzle above. But what did that give me?</strong></em></summary>
You now have access to a new room, with a glyph on the wall.
<details>
<summary><em>Sometimes the glyph on the wall changes. What does that mean?</em></summary>
When does the glyph change? What are you doing when the glyph changes?
<details>
<summary><em>Just pressing buttons. What does the glyph mean?</em></summary>
This room translates glyphs to controller inputs. This teaches you how to input passwords. Experiment with it for a bit and I'm sure it will make sense.
<details>
<summary><em>Can you fully explain how to read these glyphs?</em></summary>
Glyphs have two parts: (1) an L shape rotated in some configuration. This indicates two d-pad directions that need to be pressed, in clockwise order. For instance, the shape L would correspond to pressing UP and then RIGHT in succession; and (2) a line along one of the sides. This corresponds to a face (ABXY) button to hold while pressing these d-pad buttons. For instance, an L with a line on top of it would represent pressing UP then RIGHT while holding X.
</details>
</details>
</details>
</details>

### Subterrane 

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ There are blocks with symbols that rotate when I hit them. What do they mean?</strong></em></summary>
They correspond to the pipe junction in the same room in some way. Pay close attention to the symbol on the block and how it changes.
<details>
<summary><em>How does the symbol on the block affect the pipe junction?</em></summary>
It changes which pipes are connected to which inside the junction.
<details>
<summary><em>(Full Explanation.)</em></summary>
Looking at the symbol on the block, the long, straight line represents a connection that goes straight across the junction. The two L-shaped lines represent a turn inside the junction. 
</details>
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ How do I get to the area below the brown blocks?</strong></em></summary>
How do you usually get rid of brown blocks? You need to press a P-switch.
<details>
<summary><em>Where do I get a P-switch?</em></summary>
That's a bit more complicated. For that, you may need to head to the Tower.
<details>
<summary><em>Okay, I got the P-switch. But now there's a problem.</em></summary>
Depending on how you got the P-switch, the dotted-line blocks might now be filled. You need to find a way to get the P-switch without running the water through Subterrane.
<details>
<summary><em>But I need the springboard to get into the Tower, and that requires draining the water.</em></summary>
You either need another way to get the springboard, or another way into the Tower
<details>
<summary><em>How else can I get the springboard?</em></summary>
There's another path into Caldera from Treetops. It requires a hint from somewhere in Tower.
<details>
<summary><em>(Full Explanation.)</em></summary>
The Boo in Tower tells you that there is a dance you can do for dead trees to "offer an alternative method of travel." Perform this dance where the dead trees are in Treetops.
<details>
<summary><em>Dance?</em></summary>
For that, you will need to solve the animal puzzle in Lake.
</details>
</details>
</details>
<details>
<summary><em>How else can I get into Tower?</em></summary>
There's another path into Tower from Lake. A secret path near the bottom that is hard to see.
</details>
</details>
</details>
</details>
</details>

### Caldera

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ How do I get to the springboard?</strong></em></summary>
You need to clear the orange blocks by pressing the orange switch, which is on the opposite side of the lava bridge.
<details>
<summary><em>Okay, I did that, but I still need to cross the small pool of lava. How do I get across?</em></summary>
Follow the purple pipe. It leads back to Subterrane.
<details>
<summary><em>What do I need to do in Subterrane?</em></summary>
You will need to solve the pipe puzzle in Subterrane and then hit the switch to make the water flow. This will cool the lava to let you cross.
</details>
</details>
</details>

### Tower

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ How do I enter the Tower?</strong></em></summary>
Door's locked. Need a key.
<details>
<summary><em>Yeah, I can see that, but I can't even reach the door. How do I get to the door?</em></summary>
Big jump. Need a springboard.
<details>
<summary><em>I can only carry one item at a time. How am I supposed to bring a key and a springboard?</em></summary>
Talk to the Blarggh in Caldera for a tip.
<details>
<summary><em>I don't understand the Blarggh's hint.</em></summary>
He tells you that all you need is "a bit of shoulder work." What could that be referring to? (Look at your controller)
<details>
<summary><em>(Full explanation.)</em></summary>
When holding an item, press the L or R button to store that item in your item box. Now you can carry one item in your item box and one item in your hands, allowing you to move two items as needed.
</details>
</details>
</details>
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ I found a room with four blocks with glyphs on them in the right tower. What do I do here?</strong></em></summary>
These blocks correspond to four of something else in another part of the tower.
<details>
<summary><em>What else are there four of?</em></summary>
There are four Boo statues in the left tower, in the room next to the giant clock.
<details>
<summary><em>What do the with these statues?</em></summary>
Have you seen these Boos in another area of the Tower? Take a look around and see what you can find.
<details>
<summary><em>I found them. What now?</em></summary>
Each one is associated with a clock.
<details>
<summary><em>How do I convert the time on the clocks to a glyph for the blocks?</em></summary>
Look back at the giant clock again.
</details>
</details>
</details>
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ How do I reach the door behind the wall?</strong></em></summary>
There is a passageway in the room above.
<details>
<summary><em>(Full Explanation.)</em></summary>
The tile under the stairs on the right is broken. Go under the stairs and walk into the wall and you'll reach the other side. This will give you access to the inaccessible door and an alternate path into Caldera.
</details>
</details>

### Precipice

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ How do I get to Precipice? I've never even heard of that place.</strong></em></summary>
The entrance is at the top of Origin. You'll need the springboard from Caldera to reach the entrance to Precipice.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ I climbed Precipice, but now I can't get to the very top. How do I get up there?</strong></em></summary>
You need a tool to help you jump higher. A springboard might help.
<details>
<summary><em>I used the springboard to get into Precipice. Is there a second springboard?</em></summary>
No. There is only one springboard.
<details>
<summary><em>How do I enter Precipice with the springboard?</em></summary>
You'll need to find an alternate entrance to Precipice. There is one somewhere in Subterrane.
</details>
</details>
</details>

### Finale

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ I reached the top of Precipice. What do I do here?</strong></em></summary>
It is time to wake the star. You will need to combine a lot of the clues that you've learned from around the realm.
<details>
<summary><em>What clues do I need in particular?</em></summary>
Talk to the Swooper in Subterrane and the Monty Mole in Precipice for more information.
<details>
<summary><em>I know I need to perform the Glyphs of Origin, but how do I know what order?</em></summary>
Each glyph corresponds to one subarea of the realm. How might you order these regions? Have you seen anything that might number these regions in some way?
<details>
<summary>(Full Explanation.)</summary>
The signs outside each region has a number from 1 to 6. Order the Glyphs of Origin by these numbers and perform this dance for the star to wake it up.
</details>
</details>
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary><em><strong>❓ What can I do after I've beaten the game?</strong></em></summary>
What follows are spoilers about things to do or see after beating the game. Please only click through if you've woken the star and seen the credits.
<details>
<summary><em>I understand.</em></summary>

You're not done yet!

## Second Dream

If you open the same file again, you should notice that things are slightly different. The immediate observation should be that there is no longer a timer. You are free to take all the time you need.
