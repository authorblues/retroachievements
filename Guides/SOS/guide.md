# Game Overview

> September 13, 1921, 11 min past 7 in the evening– luxury liner Lady Crithania, sailing off the coast of Humbleton, is wrecked in stormy weather. It sank within 6 hours, after capsizing due to enormous waves. 2,300 people including crew are all reported missing. It was the worst disaster in seafaring history.

The goal of SOS is to find a way to escape the ship within the game's time limit of one real world hour. If your character gets knocked out in any way (such as falling a great distance or getting hit by a falling object), you will lose five minutes from the clock.

Escape can be challenging since the Lady Crithania is not only a giant, labyrinthian cruise ship, but it is also tricky to traverse due to the ship being turned upside-down due to the initial capsize and its angle frequently rotating as it gets closer to sinking. In addition, traversal can get even trickier as time ticks closer to the one hour deadline, since the ship's rotations will gradually get more intense, along with parts of the ship eventually beginning to fill with water.

Of course, if you want a good ending, you don't just want to escape on your own; you also want to gather as many survivors as you can (more information on those ending requirements in the "Suggested Routes for Best Ending" section). This is something else that adds to the game's difficulty and complexity. Finding and rescuing survivors takes precious time (especially since many will take a bit of convincing first), and survivors also require heavy guidance if you wish to keep them alive, since their movement is mainly determined by how you direct them, and they permanently die if they fall a great distance.

When starting out, this game can easily feel overwhelming and at times frustrating (especially when encountering situations where the game's survivor AI refuses to cooperate or seems to have a death wish), but if you can get past this game's high learning curve, SOS is a very interesting experience that isn't quite like any other game on the SNES (or any other game system, for that matter), and you might even find it fun! For that reason, this guide was created to cover not only the game's achievements, but to also give more info on managing many of the game's mechanics and other points of difficulty. Hopefully this guide will not only help you complete the set, but also make it easier to enjoy the process!

### Calling and Leading Survivors

Press L or R (shoulder buttons) to call your survivors to the location you are standing at, with the position you called them to being indicated by a yellow arrow. This arrow will not follow your position, but rather acts a gathering point. While moving survivors with this method can be tedious over longer distances, it also tends to be the most reliable and precise way to lead them, so it is often best for getting them past tricker platforms and more dangerous locations.

> [!TIP]
> You can call survivors from a neighboring room as well, though expect to wait longer if they were farther away from the entrance.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't leave your friends behind! Survivors will leave your party if you are two or more rooms away from where they are.

If you want survivors to follow behind you automatically as you walk, get all your survivors to stand still at a single spot. When the survivors reach the gathering point, the arrow will turn red. Stand on the red arrow, then hold down the L or R button, and the survivors will follow you as you walk (as best as their AI can manage) until you let go of the L/R button.

Moving survivors with this method is more simple and convenient, so it often works well for moving them over longer distances, especially if it is a safer area with less dangerous or awkward jumps. That said, it is still important to keep an eye on your survivors even when using this method, since it is possible for them to get stuck on obstacles, fall behind, or die if they miss a jump. 

> [!TIP]
> Keep in mind that survivors will only follow you into the next room if the first survivor in your party is near you when you transition.

### Grabbing Survivors

When your followed survivors are jumping towards your location, if you are concerned that they may not safely land the jump, it is possible to grab their hand and pull them up to you by pressing Y. This is especially useful as a way to help your survivors make trickier or more dangerous jumps, or to help get them unstuck when the survivor AI gets stuck in a loop. Also, note that holding down the Y button won't work; you need to press it at the right time.

> [!TIP]
> For best results, don't try to time the Y button -- just mash Y. There's no need to mash rapidly. Just tap the button.

### Skipping Protagonist Intro Stories

While the game's intros give interesting and relevant backstory, including useful context that can be helpful to figure out how to get the best ending, they can quickly get repetitive in the process of replaying the game for better endings. To skip this cutscene, simultaneously push start+select as the intro is playing out and the game will skip straight to the point where you have free control of your character pre-capsize.

## Platforming Advice

While SOS has some fairly precise platforming, you're actually pretty well-equipped to traverse most of it due to the large amount of control you have over your jumps.

### Jump Types

![an image of a neutral jump, a jump that goes straight upwards](images/jump-neutral.png)

The **neutral jump** is a jump that goes straight upwards, and is performed by pushing the B button without pressing left/right on the d-pad. This jump provides more height, making it useful for reaching higher places. You can still control your character in midair with left and right after neutral jumping, but your horizontal movement is slow.

![an image of a long jump, a jump that covers more distance](images/jump-long.png)

The **long jump** is performed by jumping with the B button while pressing left or right, usually done while walking. It is useful whenever you need more distance, such as when jumping over gaps. You still have air control in midair when long jumping; by pressing the opposite direction of your jump, you can slow your momentum to land on a closer platform, and pressing with the direction of your jump, you can extend the distance covered.

### Reaching Higher Levels

You don’t always need to land squarely on a platform, since your protagonist will grab onto platform edges and hang spots (such as staircase railings) and can then pull themselves up onto the platform.

![an image of a man grabbing the edge of a platform](images/ledge-hang.png)

Angled walls and platforms are also climbable.

![an image of a man climbing a tilted wall](images/wall-climb.png)

Your led survivors can also grab onto ledge edges and climb angled platforms. They’re not always as consistent at it as the player is though, so they’ll sometimes need your help through carefully directing them or grabbing their hands to pull them up.

### Strategies for Challenging Rooms

#### Above Francoise Maxwell's Room

Right by the room where Francoise Maxwell is found (room 28, coordinates ?? on the map) is an upward jump to reach a higher part of the ship. This is an essential jump on many routes. To learn more about how to make this jump consistently, click to expand the section below.

<details>
<summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>

At first, it may seem like it can only be made while the ship is at an angle. However, it's actually possible to make this jump even when the ship is completely level; the grab spot just happens to be extremely precise. This below image shows the grab spot.

![image of a man hanging from a railing](images/maxwell-jump.png)

However, if you try simply jumping at that spot, you'll likely find that your character won't grab it, due to how ridiculously precise it is. However, there are two ways to make this jump a bit more consistent. The first is to use the couch just below the jump as a marker. Just have your character stand over what’s roughly the center of the couch, then neutral jump while holding right, and you might grab onto the ledge.

[[ SOS - Francoise Maxwell Horizontal Stairway Jump 2.webm ]]

Alternatively, you might be able to grab the spot by simply moving left or right a bit while neutral jumping in that general area. The video below demonstrates this less precise method by grabbing onto then intentionally dropping down from the ledge a few times, to give a better idea of how to use this alternate method.

[[ SOS - Francoise Maxwell Horizontal Stairway Jump 3.webm ]]
</details>

#### The Top of Miller Strisers' Room 

Inside the room where Miller Strisers is found (room 17, coordinates ?? on the map), there's a jump that may seem impossible at first glance, but it's actually pretty easy when you know how to handle it. To learn more about how to make this jump consistently, click to expand the section below.

<details>
<summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
As shown in the following screenshot, when the ship is completely level, even at the max height of our jump we're just barely short of reaching the ledge.

![image of a man jumping short of a ledge](images/strisers-jump.png)

This means that in order to make this jump, you need to wait for the ship's angle to change first. However, due to this being a room with a survivor in it, there's one caveat: you'll need to wait outside in order for the ship to rotate, because the game generally tries to maintain the ship's current angle while most survivor cutscenes are playing out (and on many routes, you may not want or be able to save Miller Strisers). Step outside of the room and wait for the angle to change, then return. Either a left or right angle will work.

**When the ship is angled left**, the jump is pretty simple. Just jump onto the wall to the left, then you can climb or jump up to the ledge from there, as shown here in the video below.

[[ SOS - Miller Strisers Jump Left Angle 1.webm ]]

**When the ship is angled right**, the jump is a bit more precise. Walk onto the upper tip on the edge of the platform near the top and jump towards the ledge from there.

![image of a man standing on the corner of a platform](images/strisers-tilt-right.png)

[[ SOS - Miller Strisers Jump Right Angle 2.webm ]]

If you have trouble doing the jump from a standing position, you can also quickly walk left over the upper tip of the edge, then immediately take a step back to the right and make the jump, as shown below.

[[ SOS - Miller Strisers Jump Right Angle 3.webm ]]

## Advanced Techniques

The techniques below can be helpful for completing the more challenging aspects of this game.

### Teleporting Survivors

When you don't want to navigate survivors through an area, another option is to "teleport" them past it. To do this, head to the next screen on your own and then call your survivors over to your new screen with the L or R button, and they'll hopefully appear after some time has passed. You'll know they've all successfully teleported over if the survivor arrow turns red.

"Teleporting" survivors like this can be unreliable, especially if not done carefully, since there are multiple variables that affect how long survivors will appear when called to a new screen, and whether they even appear at all. Here's some advice for making survivor teleporting more reliable:

- Even after you reach the next screen, the game still keeps track of survivor locations on the previous screen in some capacity, since survivors who are further away from the doorway to your current screen will often take more time to show up, and can occasionally get stuck in transit.

> [!TIP]
> It is often better not to try and teleport survivors over very long distances. On bigger maps, try to bring them part of the way first.

- Survivors seem more likely to get stuck on the previous screen if they were in the middle of moving to a new location during the screen transition. For best results, have your survivors all settled at a single location before you change rooms to teleport them.

> [!TIP]
> If survivors are refusing to teleport even after some time has passed, you may need to briefly return to the previous screen to get them unstuck.

> [!WARNING]
> If the previous room is safe, you may want to look for them and make sure they're not caught on an obstacle (and then either pull them up or use the L/R call commands to try and redirect their movement if they are). However, if the previous room is dangerous, due to obstacles or the risk of falling, returning to the previous screen could result in a survivor dropping to their death. In cases like these, briefly enter the previous room and then return to your current room as quickly as possible, that way you can hopefully get the survivors unstuck before any have the chance to fall and die.

Unfortunately, survivor teleporting is something that is near-impossible to get 100% reliable, so while it can be extremely useful when used correctly, it's not a replacement for the other [basic movement methods](#calling-and-leading-survivors).

### The Boiler Room Skip

The Boiler Room can be a fairly dangerous final gauntlet. Survivors will attempt to make jumps that, without constant supervision by the player, are all but certain death. There is, however, a trick that lets you safely get your survivors to the top without the risk of a rogue survivor suddenly jumping to their doom.

First, leave your survivors near the entrance. The exact position doesn't matter.

![survivors standing together at the start of the boiler room](images/boiler-start.png)

Quickly climb to the top of the boiler room on your own. If you are quick enough, you can reach the top before the first explosion, which happens after a set amount of time has passed. When this happens, fireballs will start raining down. Purposely get hit by a fireball to get knocked out.

> [!WARNING]
> Time doesn't pass normally in the boiler room, but getting knocked out does advance the clock by five minutes. Don't attempt this skip unless you have at least six minutes left on the clock.

![Capris jumping into a falling fireball](images/boiler-fire.png)

Once you regain consciousness, your survivors will be standing nearby, allowing them to rejoin you at the top without dealing with the dangerous climb. **Don't forget to talk to them to have them rejoin your party.**

![Capris standing next to a survivor near the top of the boiler room](images/boiler-wakeup.png)

One benefit to this skip is that even if you climb too slowly and the fireballs fall before you reach the top, you can still get hit by them to have the survivors teleport part of the way up (they'll generally be near wherever you got knocked out), at which point you can resume the climb the normal way from that point forward.

### Doomed Passengers

The following passengers are not part of the achievement set, nor can they be rescued, so interacting with them will only slow you down.

![two passengers trapped in an elevator](images/doomed-elevator.png)

There are **two unnamed crewmen trapped in an elevator** who will tell you to talk to someone in the control room for help. Unfortunately, that person is in no state to help them, making rescuing these two impossible.

![woman collapsed on the floor of the ballroom](images/doomed-woman-ballroom.png)

There is a **woman collapsed on the floor of the ballroom** who is too injured to save. While her identity isn't specified, she's presumably Jack Hamilton's mother since she always mentions his name.

![Paddock, in the control room](images/doomed-paddock.png)

There is **Paddock**, who can be found in the control room. He'll call out for help, but he's doomed to die from his injuries. He is the man the crewmen in the elevator wanted help from. Luke will recognize Paddock and have slightly more to say to him, but will still be powerless to help.



# Best Endings

> [!WARNING]
> Several of the suggested survivor lists earn you more than the necessary 25 points. While it might seem optimal to skip some passengers and only do what is necessary, there are two reasons to rescue more survivors. First, more points can give you a bit of flexibility with mistakes. The second and primary rationale for having a full party of seven survivors is to skip the encounter with [the chief engineer, Ussar](#ach-ussar). **This encounter is especially dangerous for Capris and Luke, so navigate this encounter with them at your own risk!**

## Capris Wisher

Capris Wisher starts at a location that lets him quickly reach his key survivor, Amy Markarson, along with other high-value survivors, so his route is relatively straightforward. 

**Suggested Survivor Checklist** (*28 points total*):
- [ ] [Anna Tamaro](#survivor-anna) (6) + [Frank Coney](#survivor-frank) (3)
- [ ] 🔑 [Amy Markarson](#survivor-amy) (4)
- [ ] [Stacy Smith](#survivor-stacy) (4) + [Pamela Smith](#survivor-pamela) (4) + [Cooper Smith](#survivor-cooper) (2)
- [ ] [Jack Hamilton](#survivor-jack) (5)

![a map of the ship with a highlighted route for Capris' best ending](images/route-map-capris.png)

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. During Capris' intro, immediately walk to room 23 on the map (the above map shows the ship post-capsize, so you will need to navigate the map upside-down) so you can rescue [Anna Tamaro](#survivor-anna) and [Frank Coney](#survivor-frank) as soon as the ship capsizes.

2. Head upwards to [Amy Markarson](#survivor-amy)'s room (2 on the map) to rescue her.

3. Make your way to the room where the [Smith family](#survivor-cooper) is taking refuge (14 on the map) to rescue them. If you reach this room after 33 minutes have passed, they will have left.

4. Wait for the brief cutscene to play at 33 minutes (fast forward to get to this point if needed). Once the ship starts tilting further, you will be able to climb the elevator shaft towards [Jack Hamilton](#survivor-jack) (who won't appear before 33 minutes anyways). Rescue him.

5. Finally, head toward the boiler room while keeping everyone alive, then escape. If you still have a full party of seven, you won't have to worry about dealing with the chief engineer, Ussar.

This guy's a real jerk who will impede your attempts to save him, along with Pamela Smith (his wife) and Stacy Smith (his daughter). The way to convince Cooper to allow you to rescue his family is as follows:

- As **Capris** and **Redwin**, keep talking without missing any prompts and they'll join.
- As **Luke**, keep talking without missing any "Answer?" prompts, then as soon as there's a break in the conversation and you get a "Communication?" prompt instead, talk with Pamela (the woman on the right), then keep talking until the Smiths agree to join.
- As **Jeffrey**, keep talking with Cooper specifically until Jeffrey mentions he wants Cooper's trust in exchange for treating Pamela. Next, talk to Pamela (the woman on the right) twice, so Jeffrey introduces himself as a doctor, then push Y to treat Pamela's injury. Finally, talk with Pamela and the Smiths should all join you. *(Note: This needs to be followed exactly. Doing any of the steps in the wrong order may cause Cooper to get mad, preventing his entire family from joining.)*

In order to convince her you'll need to talk to Dr. Hendrix (who's lying on the ground by her) once talking with her no longer advances the conversation (When playing as Jeffrey, you’ll need to do this at two separate points in the conversation.)

After convincing Anna, Frank Coney will automatically join alongside her unless you’re playing as Redwin, who will have Anna join alone. In this case, you will need to talk to Frank separately if you wish to rescue him.

While he's linked with Anna Tamaro and typically joins with her, he'll join on his own if you talk to him before getting Anna to join you, and will still wish to join even if you fail to convince her (not that you'd typically want to take him without Anna, given his lower point value). 

Redwin is also the sole exception when it comes to Frank joining with Anna; Redwin always needs to talk to Frank if you want to save him.

On some routes, rescueing her might involve using Y to interact during the conversation.

Katherine will only join your group if Angelica has already joined.

No matter who you're playing as, Kathrine has one of the most involved conversations out of any survivor, so refer to the below information if you want the specifics:

For **Capris**, **Redwin**, and **Jeffrey**:
1. Talk to Angelica Snow until she or your protagonist suggests checking on Katherine Clayton.
2. Talk with Katherine Clayton until you get no new dialogue.
3. Talk with Angelica until she hands you lipstick.
4. Push Y in front of Katherine to write messages until you get an "Answer?" prompt. Redwin will break the lipstick mid-way and need to talk to Angelica again before continuing this step.
5. Respond to the "Answer?" prompt, then keep advancing the conversation until Katherine and Angelica join.

For **Luke**:
1. Talk to Angelica Snow until Luke agrees to check on Katherine Clayton.
2. Talk with Katherine Clayton until you get no new dialogue.
3. Talk with Angelica until Luke suggests writing out a message.
4. Talk to Katherine once so Luke realizes he forgot his pen.
5. Talk to Angelica until she hands you lipstick.
6. Push Y in front of Katherine twice, so Luke writes a message.
7. Talk to Angelica, then keep responding to the prompts until she and Katherine join you.

<big><pre>
[Sad End (1)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/271846)
_Explore the ship long enough to suffer a tragic fate._
</pre></big>

This achievement is from getting a game over, which only happens when the game's 60 minute timer runs out and the aftermath fully plays out, as the game over screen only appears once your protagonist drowns. If you need to go out of your way to get this, it's easy to get by just using your emulator's fast forward button until time runs out.

[The Night Sky Awaits (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/271858)

This is the set's generic "get any ending" achievement, so you'll automatically get this one in your pursuit of the set's required endings.

<big><pre>
[Creeper Ending (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/271856)
_Poor Luke..._
</pre></big>

This achievement requires getting one of Luke's worse endings. The requirement for that ending is to escape with Ismay Townsend and less than 25 points worth of survivors, so this is easily done by just waiting in Luke's starting room until the ship capsizes, at which point you can rescue Ismay Townsend and rush to the end while keeping Ismay alive.

<big><pre>
[HURRY !!! (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/271847)
_Escape the ship before the end of the 4th minute!_
</pre></big>

This achievement is essentially a speedrun where you want to rush straight to the exit without saving any other survivors. While this can be done with any protagonist, it's slightly easier with Luke since his starting location is closest to the exit, so you can just wait where he starts until the ship capsizes, then rush to the boiler room.

Also, note that upon entering the boiler room the game's internal clock will pause, so the only way the achievement can invalidate from this point on is if you get knocked out via a fall or by being hit by fire. As such, it's best to take your time and prioritize safety when climbing through the boiler room to the exit.

## Events and Other Achievements
    
<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/40722.png">

<big><pre>
[A Nightmare Starts (1)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/271845)
_This shaking... Oh, no !_
</pre></big>

This achievement is earned automatically after a small amount of time passes. The Lady Crithania capsizes and the boat flips upside down, beginning the one hour in-game clock for you to escape with or without rescuing other passengers.

    
<a name="ach-ussar"></a>
<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/40724.png">

<big><pre>
[Don't Believe His Lies (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/271848)
_Give me my survivors back !!!_
</pre></big>

Chief Engineer Ussar will block your path to the boiler room if you have between three and six survivors in your party. You will still be at liberty to leave, but he will take control of your group of passengers if you don't navigate this conversation correctly. This achievement asks you to lose your passengers to Ussar. This is generally easy to fail:

- As **Capris**, don't respond to any of his prompts. He will leave on his own with your survivors.
- As **Luke**, respond to every prompt and Ussar will take your passengers.
- As **Jeffrey**, respond to the first "Answer?" prompt and ignore the rest.
- As **Redwin**, respond to every prompt until he explains the danger of the boiler room and asks "Are you satisfied now?", then don't respond further.

If you wish to keep your survivors, instead:

- As **Capris**, keep talking to Ussar until he tells Capris that he should check the boiler room alone, then ignore the "Answer?" prompt and don't respond. After a few seconds, Ussar will ask why Capris isn't saying anything, at which point you should answer. Ussar and Henry should then leave on their own shortly after.
- As **Luke**, keep talking until the part where Luke insults Ussar, starting with "I never liked you from the start," and Ussar responds by telling Luke he should to go to the boiler room by himself, and begins to leave with Henry. At this point, ignore the "Answer?" prompt until Ussar leaves. Henry will stay behind and talk a bit; it doesn't matter if you respond to Henry's "Answer?" prompt at this point, since either way, Henry will leave while your survivors will remain.
- As **Jeffrey**, keep talking to Ussar, and he'll eventually leave without Henry. Then speak to Henry and he'll join your group of survivors.
- As **Redwin**, keep talking to Ussar without missing any prompts until Redwin says it's a waste of time, then keep talking to Henry. Henry will end up joining your group of survivors and Ussar will leave on his own.

Once you've earned this achievement, you can avoid this interaction when doing attempts at getting the best endings by making sure you have 7 survivors in your party, the maximum party size.

<big><pre>
[Useless Map (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/271849)
_Find the map of the ship (not with Luke)_
</pre></big>

The map is found by interacting with a lady in room #18 (coordinates ##) on the map. This room is next to Capris' starting location, so you can grab this achievement within seconds with him. You can search her body after the capsize with any character to get a map if you haven't gotten it before.
    
<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/40727.png">

<big><pre>
[Sink Or Swim ! (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/271850)
_Reach the boiler room in the nick of time (after the second and final capsize cutscene)_
</pre></big>

This requires entering the boiler room after the game's internal clock has reached 60 minutes. This is indicated by a second image of the ship capsizing, followed by the music changing and the ship more rapidly filling up with water.

You won't have a lot of time to reach the boiler room once the clock hits 60 minutes, so the easiest way to get this achievement is to more quickly reach the room just outside the boiler room, then to stand by the door to the boiler room and use your emulator's fast forward button to speed things the rest of the way. Then as soon as the clock hits 60 minutes and you see the 2nd ship capsize image, you can then rush into the boiler room.
    
<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/40731.png">

<big><pre>
[Take My Hand (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/271855)
_Grab my hand !_
</pre></big>

You should get this achievement upon grabbing any survivor's hand with the Y button. Since this is an essential part of managing survivors, you should get this one automatically while playing the game.
    
<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/40733.png">

<big><pre>
[Paganini's Power! (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/271857)
_Listen to Michael play his violin to help a widow continue on._
</pre></big>

This requires bringing Michael Burnings to Katherine Meibrus for a unique interaction between them both. Michael is found in the ship's chapel (#63/64/65 on the map), which is right where Jeffrey starts, so this is quickest to do with him. Just rescue Michael, then bring him to Katherine.
