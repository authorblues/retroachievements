# Game Overview

> September 13, 1921, 11 min past 7 in the eveningâ€“ luxury liner Lady Crithania, sailing off the coast of Humbleton, is wrecked in stormy weather. It sank within 6 hours, after capsizing due to enormous waves. 2,300 people including crew are all reported missing. It was the worst disaster in seafaring history.

The goal of SOS is to find a way to escape the ship within the game's time limit of one real world hour. If your character gets knocked out in any way (such as falling a great distance or getting hit by a falling object), you will lose five minutes from the clock.

Escape can be challenging since the Lady Crithania is not only a giant, labyrinthian cruise ship, but it is also tricky to traverse due to the ship being turned upside-down due to the initial capsize and its angle frequently rotating as it gets closer to sinking. In addition, traversal can get even trickier as time ticks closer to the one hour deadline, since the ship's rotations will gradually get more intense, along with parts of the ship eventually beginning to fill with water.

Of course, if you want a good ending, you don't just want to escape on your own; you also want to gather as many survivors as you can (more information on those ending requirements in the "Suggested Routes for Best Ending" section). This is something else that adds to the game's difficulty and complexity. Finding and rescuing survivors takes precious time (especially since many will take a bit of convincing first), and survivors also require heavy guidance if you wish to keep them alive, since their movement is mainly determined by how you direct them, and they permanently die if they fall a great distance.

When starting out, this game can easily feel overwhelming and at times frustrating (especially when encountering situations where the game's survivor AI refuses to cooperate or seems to have a death wish), but if you can get past this game's high learning curve, SOS is a very interesting experience that isn't quite like any other game on the SNES (or any other game system, for that matter), and you might even find it fun! For that reason, this guide was created to cover not only the game's achievements, but to also give more info on managing many of the game's mechanics and other points of difficulty. Hopefully this guide will not only help you complete the set, but also make it easier to enjoy the process!

### Calling and Leading Survivors

Press L or R (shoulder buttons) to call your survivors to the location you are standing at, with the position you called them to being indicated by a yellow arrow. This arrow will not follow your position, but rather acts a gathering point. While moving survivors with this method can be tedious over longer distances, it also tends to be the most reliable and precise way to lead them, so it is often best for getting them past tricker platforms and more dangerous locations.

> [!TIP]
> You can call survivors from a neighboring room as well, though expect to wait longer if they were farther away from the entrance.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't leave your friends behind! Survivors will leave your party if you are two or more rooms away from where they are.

If you want survivors to follow behind you automatically as you walk, get all your survivors to stand still at a single spot. When the survivors reach the gathering point, the arrow will turn red. Stand on the red arrow, then hold down the L or R button, and the survivors will follow you as you walk (as best as their AI can manage) until you let go of the L/R button.

Moving survivors with this method is more simple and convenient, so it often works well for moving them over longer distances, especially if it is a safer area with less dangerous or awkward jumps. That said, it is still important to keep an eye on your survivors even when using this method, since it is possible for them to get stuck on obstacles, fall behind, or die if they miss a jump. 

> [!TIP]
> Keep in mind that survivors will only follow you into the next room if the first survivor in your party is near you when you transition.

### Grabbing Survivors

When your followed survivors are jumping towards your location, if you are concerned that they may not safely land the jump, it is possible to grab their hand and pull them up to you by pressing Y. This is especially useful as a way to help your survivors make trickier or more dangerous jumps, or to help get them unstuck when the survivor AI gets stuck in a loop. Also, note that holding down the Y button won't work; you need to press it at the right time.

> [!TIP]
> For best results, don't try to time the Y button -- just mash Y. There's no need to mash rapidly. Just tap the button.

### Skipping Protagonist Intro Stories

While the game's intros give interesting and relevant backstory, including useful context that can be helpful to figure out how to get the best ending, they can quickly get repetitive in the process of replaying the game for better endings. To skip this cutscene, simultaneously push start+select as the intro is playing out and the game will skip straight to the point where you have free control of your character pre-capsize.

## Platforming Advice

While SOS has some fairly precise platforming, you're actually pretty well-equipped to traverse most of it due to the large amount of control you have over your jumps.

### Jump Types

| ![neutral jump](images/jump-neutral.png) | 
|:--| 
| *The neutral jump is a jump that goes straight upwards.* |

The **neutral jump** is your default jump, which is performed by pushing the B button without pressing left/right on the d-pad. This jump provides more height, making it useful for reaching higher places. You can still control your character in midair with left and right after neutral jumping, but your horizontal movement is slow.

| ![long jump](images/jump-long.png) | 
|:--| 
| *The long jump is a jump that covers more distance.* |

The **long jump** is performed by jumping with the B button while pressing left or right, usually done while walking. It is useful whenever you need more distance, such as when jumping over gaps. You still have air control in midair when long jumping; by pressing the opposite direction of your jump, you can slow your momentum to land on a closer platform, and pressing with the direction of your jump, you can extend the distance covered.
